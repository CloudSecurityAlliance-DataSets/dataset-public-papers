**Summary of “Navigating the Risks: A Survey of Security, Privacy, and Ethics Threats in LLM-Based Agents”**

- **Motivation & Scope**  
  - Outlines the rising security, privacy, and ethics vulnerabilities of Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents.  
  - Proposes a novel taxonomy and describes key features (e.g., LLM-based controller, multi-modal inputs, multi-round interaction) that expand the attack surface beyond standalone LLMs.

## 1. Taxonomy of Threats

- **Threat Sources (Rows):**  
  1. **Problematic Inputs**: Attacks exploiting adversarial inputs or manipulations (e.g., adversarial examples [161, 299], prompt injection, goal hijacking [88], model extraction [35]).  
  2. **Model Flaws**: Hallucinations [75, 160], memorization [32], and bias [250] inherent in large-scale transformer models.  
  3. **Combined Threats**: Backdoors [66] and privacy leakage [36] triggered by both malicious inputs and intrinsic vulnerabilities.

- **Threat Types (Columns):**  
  1. **Security/Safety**: Incorrect or harmful outputs (e.g., adversarial examples, backdoors).  
  2. **Privacy**: Leakage of user prompts or training data (e.g., prompt leakage [112], memorization-induced leaks).  
  3. **Ethics**: Unfair or biased outputs (e.g., bias and discrimination [81, 250]).

This two-dimensional framework (source vs. threat type) covers cross-module and cross-stage risks that older taxonomies overlooked.

## 2. Key Features of LLM-Based Agents

1. **LLM-Based Controller**: Central decision-making, bridging text understanding, tool usage, and planning.  
2. **Multi-Modal Inputs/Outputs**: Incorporates text, images, or speech. Multimodal synergy can increase adversarial channels [299].  
3. **Multi-Source Inputs**: Multiple data streams—user instructions, system prompts, environment feedback, memory—expand potential points of attack [314].  
4. **Multi-Round Interaction**: Iterative dialogue with the environment or other agents complicates threat landscapes (e.g., progressive prompt injections [47]).  
5. **Memory Mechanism**: Storing context or external database results (e.g., retrieval-augmented generation) can introduce backdoor or privacy risks [338].  
6. **Tool Invocation**: LLM calls external APIs or modules. Vulnerable to hijacks forcing unwanted tool usage (e.g., malicious commands [66]).

## 3. Detailed Threats & Current Mitigations

• **Problematic Inputs**  
  - **Adversarial Examples**: Move beyond single-modality and simple text perturbations; SOTA defenses include input purification or adversarial training [232].  
  - **Goal Hijacking**: Attackers inject prompts to override developers’ constraints, including indirect injection (web-based or memory-based) [314].  
  - **Prompt Leakage & Model Extraction**: Malicious queries or output analysis (stealing system prompts or partial model parameters [35]); defenses often involve watermarking [296].  
  - **Jailbreaking**: Bypasses alignment restrictions (safety rules) via optimized or exploit-based prompts [337]; defenses are detection-based or purification-based (e.g., safe decoding [289]).

• **Model Flaws**  
  - **Hallucination**: Arises from incomplete data, imbalanced corpora, or incorrect decoding in LLMs [117]; partial solutions include RAG [205] or advanced decoding [49, 237].  
  - **Memorization**: Retains training samples or context-specific data, risking private info leakage [32]. Balancing memorization with generalization remains unsolved.  
  - **Bias**: Reinforced by large, unlabeled training data or algorithmic design [81]; mitigation includes data filtering, model fine-tuning with fairness objectives, or re-decoding [50].

• **Combined Threats**  
  - **Backdoor**: Malicious triggers yield targeted misbehavior (e.g., tool misuse [66]); defenses include dataset sanitation, input purification, output verification.  
  - **Privacy Leakage**: Either direct (training data extraction [36]) or contextual (RAG-based leakage [312]); mitigations are differential privacy [141], unlearning [203], and context sanitization [311].

## 4. Case Studies

1. **WebGPT [189]**  
   - Tools for web browsing (Bing); stronger memory mechanism for real-time data.  
   - Reduces hallucination with external references but is more vulnerable to multi-source input-based attacks, e.g., goal hijacking via malicious webpages.

2. **Voyager [263]**  
   - Embodied in Minecraft; uses GPT-3.5/4.0 to generate code.  
   - Susceptible to code-related hallucinations. Maintains skill libraries in “memory,” heightening backdoor risks.

3. **PReP [310]**  
   - Multi-LLM agent for city navigation with text/image inputs.  
   - Multi-modal adversarial examples (visual + text) can be powerful. Hallucinations become acute in low-resource or specialized domains (Beijing landmarks).

4. **ChatDev [212]**  
   - Multi-agent system for code generation; dynamic testing on system kernels.  
   - Complex multi-round agent cooperation can magnify biases or small hallucinations, plus instruction-backdoor possibilities.

## 5. Future Directions

• **Data Support**  
  - Richer benchmarks beyond single-turn, single-modality tasks (e.g., multi-round, domain-focused, multi-LLM).  
  - More cross-lingual/multimodal datasets to stress-test hallucinations, goal hijacking, and backdoors in real scenarios.

• **Methodological Advancements**  
  - **Rigorous Theoretical Framework:** Formal definitions for hallucination and bias to enable standardized metrics.  
  - **Interpretability-Driven Strategies:** Mining internal neuron activations for attack and defense design [5].  
  - **Agent-Specific Security:** Holistic solutions accounting for multi-LLM interplay, memory, and tool usage.

• **Policy & Governance**  
  - Define a standard “Agent Constitution” clarifying memory management, tool interactions, and multi-source input rules.  
  - Update regulatory policies (e.g., AI Act [255]) to account for privacy and liability aspects in LLM-based agents.  
  - Government or industry funding to investigate advanced safety mechanisms (e.g., stable alignment, robust verification).

Overall, the survey underscores that LLM-based agents introduce cross-module, cross-stage threats beyond traditional NLP concerns. A comprehensive risk assessment—covering data, methodology, and policy—is pivotal to mitigating potential harm as these versatile systems move into real-world applications.
