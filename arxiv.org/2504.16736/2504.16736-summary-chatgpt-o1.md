## Summary of “A Survey of AI Agent Protocols”

- **Motivation & Scope**  
  - As Large Language Model (LLM)–based agents proliferate, a lack of standardized communication protocols causes fragmentation and hinders collaboration.  
  - This survey analyzes existing agent communication protocols—focusing on frameworks that govern interactions between agents themselves and between agents and external resources.

### Two-Dimensional Classification of Agent Protocols

1. **Context-Oriented Protocols**  
   - Aim to standardize how agents obtain external context (data, tools, services).  
   - Often address limitations of ad hoc function-calling: improved interoperability, security, and reduced fragmentation.  
   - Two main categories:
     - **General-Purpose**:  
       - Example: Model Context Protocol (MCP) [Anthropic, 2024].  
         - Decouples LLM responses from actual tool calls.  
         - Uses a client-server architecture with four components (Host, Client, Server, Resource).  
         - Emphasizes authentication, privacy, and easy integration of new tools.  
     - **Domain-Specific**:  
       - Example: agents.json [WildCardAI, 2025].  
         - Builds on OpenAPI to simplify “AI-compatible” interfaces for websites.  
         - Introduces specialized constructs (e.g., flows, links) for LLM-driven orchestration.

2. **Inter-Agent Protocols**  
   - Enable autonomous agents to collaborate, negotiate, and share tasks.  
   - Address challenges like agent discovery, trust, identity, and concurrency.  
   - Two main categories:
     - **General-Purpose**:  
       - Examples:  
         - Agent Network Protocol (ANP) [Chang, 2024]:  
           - Envisions an “Internet of Agents” with decentralized IDs (DIDs), JSON-LD.  
           - Three-layer design: identity, meta-protocol, and application.  
         - A2A (Agent2Agent) [Google, 2025]:  
           - Supports enterprise-grade agent collaboration.  
           - Uses a “task” abstraction, JSON-RPC, SSE for streaming.  
         - Others: AITP [NEAR, 2025], AComP [AI and Data, 2025], AConP [Cisco, 2025], Coral, Agora [Marro et al., 2024].  
     - **Domain-Specific**:  
       - Focus on specialized scenarios like human–agent interaction (PXP [Srinivasan et al., 2024]), robot–agent collaboration (SPPs [Gasieniec et al., 2024]), or system–agent orchestration (LMOS [Eclipse, 2025]).

### Key Evaluation Dimensions

1. **Efficiency**  
   - Latency, throughput, token overhead.  
   - Protocols must handle frequent semantic processing alongside network transmission.

2. **Scalability**  
   - Node scalability (number of tools/agents) and link scalability (communication density).  
   - Includes capability negotiation for dynamic agent/tool discovery.

3. **Security**  
   - Authentication mode diversity (tokens, OAuth, DID).  
   - Role-based access control and context redaction.

4. **Reliability**  
   - Mechanisms akin to TCP: retransmissions, flow/congestion control, persistent connections.  
   - Ensures consistent message delivery in multi-agent environments.

5. **Extensibility**  
   - Backward compatibility for protocol updates.  
   - Customizable metadata fields, modular layering for future expansions.

6. **Operability**  
   - Ease of deployment and integration (lightweight specification, minimal dependencies).  
   - Observability (monitoring throughput, error rates).

7. **Interoperability**  
   - Cross-platform and cross-browser support.  
   - Uniform JSON APIs or SDS-based data exchange.

### Use-Case Analysis Highlights

- **MCP (Single Agent)**:  
  - A central agent manages all external services (flight, hotel, weather).  
  - Simple “star” pattern but can become a bottleneck if many services or tasks scale up.

- **A2A (Within an Enterprise)**  
  - Multiple agents exchange messages directly rather than always routing via one orchestrator.  
  - Ideal for complex multi-department or multi-service collaboration.

- **ANP (Cross-Domain Interoperability)**  
  - Formalizes structured requests/responses across organizational boundaries.  
  - Emphasizes decentralized identities and protocols.

- **Agora (Natural Language–Driven Protocol Generation)**  
  - Intermediary layers handle user requests, transform them into structured protocols, and direct them to specialized agents.  
  - Separates natural-language interpretation from domain-level tasks.

### Academic Outlook

1. **Short-Term**  
   - Emphasis on standardized benchmarks for protocol performance.  
   - Privacy-preserving protocols (e.g., access control, partial or anonymized data sharing).  
   - Emergence of group-level communication “mesh” protocols for multi-agent transparency.  
   - Shift from static to “evolvable” protocols that agents can adapt or learn on the fly.

2. **Mid-Term**  
   - Built-in protocol knowledge in specialized LLMs for more seamless interaction.  
   - Layered architectures that separate transport from semantic coordination.  
   - Closer integration of ethical and legal constraints at higher protocol layers.

3. **Long-Term**  
   - Collective intelligence at scale, with agent populations forming adaptive, web-scale networks.  
   - Dedicated “Agent Data Networks,” machine-oriented analogs to the human-centric web.  
   - Protocols evolve into core infrastructures for truly distributed, autonomous AI systems.

### Conclusion

- The survey illuminates a rapidly advancing field focused on enabling LLM-based multi-agent systems to interoperate critically and securely.  
- Newly introduced protocols address context retrieval, inter-agent negotiation, and security challenges but differ widely in architecture, domain specificity, and maturity.  
- Future efforts will push beyond simple API-mediated interactions: layered, evolvable protocols, privacy-aware collaborations, and scalable intelligence networks are poised to reshape how autonomous agents cooperate and reason.
