**Summary of “Securing GenAI Multi-Agent Systems Against Tool Squatting: A Zero Trust Registry-Based Approach”**

- **Context and Motivation**  
  - Multi-agent systems (MAS) increasingly rely on generative AI (GenAI) agents interacting with external tools via interoperability protocols (e.g., Google’s Agent2Agent (A2A) [1, 7] and Anthropic’s Model Context Protocol (MCP) [2]).  
  - A novel security threat, **tool squatting**, occurs when malicious actors deceptively register or present tools to gain unauthorized access or impersonate legitimate services.

- **Tool Squatting Threat Landscape**  
  - Malicious registration or misrepresentation of tool identities.  
  - Exploits open discovery and uncontrolled registration mechanisms, allowing fake endpoints or manipulated metadata.  
  - Impact: Unauthorized resource usage, data exfiltration, compromise of entire systems, and erosion of trust within MAS.  
  - Attack vectors span internal threats (e.g., compromised administrators or internal agent tampering) and external adversaries hosting spoofed MCP servers.

- **Proposed Tool Registry Framework**  
  - **Core Idea**: A Zero Trust approach with centralized, administrator-controlled registries for both agents and tools.  
  - **Main Components** (Figure 1 in paper):  
    1. **Tool Registry Service**: Stores vetted tool metadata (e.g., endpoint, version, dependencies), calculates trust scores, and responds to discovery queries.  
    2. **Agent Registry Service**: Maintains verified agent identities (UUID, roles, allowed tools).  
    3. **Access Control Service**: Evaluates fine-grained policies that link *which agent* can access *which tool* under specified conditions (time-of-day, trust-score thresholds, etc.).  
    4. **Credential Management Service**: Issues short-lived, scoped credentials (JIT provisioning [6]) to reduce risks from stolen or persistent secrets.  
    5. **Monitoring Service**: Logs requests, analyzes anomalies, and supports auditing.

- **Key Security Mechanisms**  
  - **Administrator-Gated Registration**:  
    - Only registered and approved tools/agents appear in discovery, preventing malicious actors from introducing fake entries.  
    - Agent and Tool “CUD” (Create, Update, Delete) privileges restricted to trusted personnel or a two-person rule.  
  - **Authenticated Discovery**:  
    - Agents authenticate to the registry before requesting tool listings.  
    - Discovery results filtered by the agent’s identity, applied policies, and trust scores.  
    - Reference to cryptographically signed metadata ensures authenticity [16].  
  - **Just-in-Time (JIT) Credentials**:  
    - Ephemeral tokens issued only upon successful policy checks.  
    - Enforces least-privilege scopes for each accessed resource, mitigating credential theft impacts [6].  
  - **Dynamic Trust Scores**:  
    - Tools assigned numeric or categorical scores reflecting version age, known CVEs, and maintenance history.  
    - Enables agents or policies to enforce minimum trust thresholds (e.g., “tool trust_score ≥ 75”).  
  - **Audit and Monitoring**:  
    - Comprehensive logs for tool usage, agent registrations, access requests, and trust score updates.  
    - Facilitates anomaly detection (e.g., suspicious usage patterns) [14, 19].

- **Integration with A2A and MCP**  
  - **A2A**: Registry can provide authentic “Agent Cards” and ensure tasks flow only among registered, trusted agents and tools [1, 7].  
  - **MCP**: Secured MCP servers must be listed in the Tool Registry, with validated endpoints. JIT credentials authenticate legitimate agents for requests [2, 8].  
  - **Result**: A layered approach that supplements existing MAS protocols with centralized identity, trust, and access control.

- **Implementation Highlights** (Proof of Concept)  
  - Microservices architecture (FastAPI for REST [20], PostgreSQL for data, Redis for caching/rate limiting [21]).  
  - JSON-based policies referencing agent/tool identifiers.  
  - JWT-based authentication tokens for verified agent sessions [17].  
  - Vault/Secrets Managers store static keys, integrated with ephemeral credential issuance [15].  
  - Policymaking approach: “Policy as code” [23] to automate lifecycle, versioning, and incorporate minimum trust score logic.

- **Limitations and Future Directions**  
  - **Centralization**: Single point of failure and potential bottleneck; high availability is mandatory.  
  - **Administrative Overhead**: Manual sign-off required for every new tool/agent registration may impede agility.  
  - **Scope**: Addresses registration, discovery, and controlled access but does not solve all downstream tool vulnerabilities or insider compromise.  
  - **Possible Extensions**:  
    1. **Automated Verification** of tools and endpoints before registration.  
    2. **Decentralized Trust** (DIDs/VCs [24]) to reduce single-admin reliance.  
    3. **Standardization** across MAS frameworks.  
    4. **Further Empirical Testing** and red-team evaluations, refining the trust-scoring model.

**Conclusion**  
This paper proposes a robust, zero trust–aligned Tool Registry framework to eradicate the core threat of tool squatting in GenAI multi-agent systems. By enforcing administrator-vetted registrations, dynamic trust assessment, fine-grained access policies, and just-in-time credential provisioning, the design provides a structured blueprint to prevent deceptive or malicious tools from infiltrating enterprise-grade MAS. These controls fortify interoperability protocols (A2A, MCP) and align with enterprise security best practices, offering a scalable foundation for secure, future-proof multi-agent deployments.
