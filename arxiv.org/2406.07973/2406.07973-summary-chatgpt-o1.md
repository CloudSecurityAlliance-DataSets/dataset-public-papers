**Summary of “Unique Security and Privacy Threats of Large Language Model: A Comprehensive Survey”**

---

### Overview
- The paper provides a taxonomy of privacy and security threats targeting Large Language Models (LLMs) across five distinct **threat scenarios**:
  1. **Pre-training**  
  2. **Fine-tuning**  
  3. **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems**  
  4. **Deployment of LLMs**  
  5. **Deployment of LLM-based agents**  
- Each scenario exhibits unique risks compared to traditional (smaller-scale) language models due to LLMs’ massive parameter counts, emergent capabilities, and specialized life-cycle stages.

### Pre-training Stage (§3.1, §4)
1. **Privacy Risks**  
   - **Private-data memorization** (§4.1):  
     - LLMs memorize sensitive details within large-scale corpora, enabling white-box attackers to extract user data (e.g., personal identifiers).  
     - Attack methods include data extraction and inference attacks leveraging LLM parameters.
   - **Countermeasures** (§4.3.1):  
     - **Corpora cleaning**: Remove personally identifiable information (PII) or duplicate data from training sets.  
     - **Privacy-preserving training**: Differential privacy (e.g., DPSGD) can introduce noise during gradient updates, limiting data leakage.

2. **Security Risks**  
   - **Toxic data learning** (§4.2):  
     - LLMs trained on unfiltered corpora may generate harmful or illegal text (e.g., biased or violent content).  
   - **Poisoning & backdoor attacks**:  
     - Malicious developers or external contributors can embed triggers in LLMs to force malicious outputs on specific prompts.  
   - **Countermeasures** (§4.3.2):  
     - **Corpora filtering**: Detect and remove toxic samples without over-restricting model utility.  
     - **Model-based defenses**: Identify suspicious triggers (e.g., perplexity-based, pruning, weight analysis) or apply robust fine-tuning to neutralize backdoors.

---

### Fine-tuning Stage (§3.2, §5)
1. **Security Risks**  
   - **Backdoor attacks in instruction tuning or RLHF** (§5.1):  
     - Attackers poison the fine-tuning datasets (instructions, preference data), leading the LLM to misbehave with specific triggers.  
   - **Poisoning by malicious contributors or trainers**:  
     - Outsourced trainers can manipulate fine-tuning data or processes to embed hidden behaviors.
2. **Countermeasures** (§5.2)  
   - **Input-based detection**: E.g., rewriting or perturbing suspicious prompts to break hidden triggers before model processing.  
   - **Model-based defenses**: Knowledge distillation or pruning to remove suspicious neurons.  
   - **Data-based filtering**: Clustering or contribution-score approaches to detect and eliminate poisoned samples.

### Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Systems (§3.3, §6)
1. **Privacy Risks**  
   - **Knowledge stealing** (§6.1):  
     - RAG relies on external knowledge bases that contain sensitive or proprietary data. Attackers construct prompts to extract this information.
2. **Security Risks**  
   - **Poisoned knowledge bases** (§6.2):  
     - Malicious contributors embed misleading or malicious documents so the LLM retrieves harmful or incorrect context.  
3. **Countermeasures** (§6.3)  
   - **Corpora filtering**: Detect abnormal or high-perplexity entries, remove or correct them prior to retrieval.  
   - **Robust retrieval**: Re-ranking, prompt rewriting, or summarizing retrieved content to reduce malicious data usage.

---

### Deployment of LLMs (§3.4, §7)
1. **Privacy Risks**  
   - **Prompt extraction** (§7.1.1):  
     - Prompt engineering used by attackers to force LLMs or integrated apps to leak proprietary or carefully designed prompts.  
   - **Common privacy attacks**: Membership inference, model extraction, data extraction, reconstruction.
2. **Security Risks**  
   - **Prompt injection & jailbreak attacks** (§7.2.1):  
     - Attackers craft prompts to override system instructions or evade alignment guardrails, generating harmful or disallowed outputs.  
   - **Adversarial examples** (common to all language models):  
     - Carefully perturb input text to produce unintended responses.
3. **Countermeasures** (§7.3)  
   - **Privacy**:  
     - Differential privacy during fine-tuning or inference, rule-based or classifier-based output filtering.  
     - Secure computing (e.g., SMPC, homomorphic encryption) to shield inputs and model parameters.  
   - **Security**:  
     - Output detection (keyword or semantic filtering to block problematic responses).  
     - Prompt engineering (prompt “purification” or random perturbations) to invalidate malicious text.  
     - Robustness training (adversarial training, alignment tuning) to resist malicious prompts.

### Deployment of LLM-based Agents (§3.5, §8)
1. **Privacy Risks**  
   - **Unauthorized interactions & multi-agent leakage** (§8.1):  
     - Agents may share sensitive data across sub-tasks, exposing private content if one agent becomes malicious.  
     - Interaction logs can reveal user or corporate secrets.
2. **Security Risks**  
   - **Jailbreak attacks on autonomous agents** (§8.2):  
     - Attackers bypass guardrails with carefully chained prompts, leading to harmful automated actions.  
   - **Backdoor agents**:  
     - Compromised agents perform malicious operations (e.g., hidden triggers in their “thought” processes or observation steps), potentially contaminating other agents in a network.
3. **Countermeasures** (§8.3)  
   - **Privacy**:  
     - Real-time auditing of agent communications, role-based data permission management.  
   - **Security**:  
     - Prompt filtering and adversarial training to harden agent instructions.  
     - Multi-level consistency checks to detect and isolate malicious agents.

### Future Directions (§9)
- **Federated Learning for LLMs**:  
  - Collaborative training across multiple data providers can preserve data locality but introduces gradient-based information leakage and backdoor threats.
- **Watermarks for LLMs**:  
  - Watermarks in model outputs or parameters protect intellectual property and help identify model ownership, but advanced methods can remove or obscure them.
- **Machine Unlearning**:  
  - Removing specific user data post-hoc to comply with regulations (e.g., GDPR) remains a major challenge given LLMs’ large-scale architectures and persistent memorization.

**Key Takeaways**  
- LLMs differ from smaller-scale models in scope, data exposure, emergent capabilities, and life-cycle complexity, introducing new attack surfaces and vulnerabilities.  
- Unique threat scenarios arise at pre-training, fine-tuning, retrieval augmentation, deployment, and agent-based automation, each requiring specialized risk assessments and defenses.  
- Effective protection demands synergistic approaches (e.g., robust filtering, privacy-preserving training, alignment tuning, secure multi-agent orchestration).  
- Future research should tackle federated LLM training risks, watermarking robustness, and unlearning techniques, among other open problems.
