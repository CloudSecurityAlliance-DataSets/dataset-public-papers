**Markdown Summary**

- **Motivation & Overview**  
  - Large Language Models (LLMs) have moved beyond passive chat to become autonomous cyberattack agents, dramatically lowering barriers for sophisticated attacks.  
  - The paper introduces the concept of “Cyber Threat Inflation,” where LLM-based agents reduce attack costs and increase attack scale across various network environments.  
  - Emphasis is placed on how these agents operate in scouting, memory/knowledge retention, dynamic reasoning, multi-agent collaboration, and automated tool invocation (Section 1).  
  - The survey highlights emerging vulnerabilities in traditional network security paradigms and offers forward-looking insights for defenders (Fig. 1).

- **LLM-Based Attack Agent Architecture (Section 2)**  
  - **Core Modules**  
    - An LLM “brain” (e.g., GPT-4, Llama) handles language processing, prompt understanding, and reasoning.  
    - Open-source or proprietary models can be locally hosted or accessed via API. Attackers prefer local hosting to evade detection (Table 2).  
  - **Perception & Memory**  
    - Perception modules extract insights from OSINT, code artifacts, network traces, and more.  
    - Memory structures:  
      - Long-term knowledge from specialized security corpora (e.g., PRIMUS [208], CVE data).  
      - Short-term memory uses retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) or knowledge graphs for real-time context.  
  - **Reasoning & Planning**  
    - Agents employ chain-of-thought (CoT), tree/graph-of-thought, or ReAct loops to venture through multi-stage cyberattacks.  
    - Self-reflection modules auto-correct exploit attempts and adapt tactics.  
  - **Tool Usage**  
    - Data tools (e.g., port scanners), action tools (e.g., Metasploit), and orchestration tools coordinate large, multi-step intrusions.  
    - Benchmarks like CyberSecEval [33] and AI Cyber Risk Benchmark [160] measure how well LLM-based agents exploit vulnerabilities while ensuring controlled testing.  
  - **Multi-Agent Collaboration**  
    - Agents with different roles (scanning, exploit, exfiltration) coordinate to automate large-scale attacks (Section 2.2).  

**Lessons for Defenders**  
  - Exploit model weaknesses (limited context window, hallucinations).  
  - Deceive multi-stage reasoning via honeytokens or carefully placed obstacles.  
  - Leverage multi-agent defense teams (network monitors, file watchers, and automated responders).

- **Common Cyberattacks & Benchmarks (Sections 3, Table 3 & Table 5)**  
  - **Threat Intelligence Gathering & OSINT**  
    - LLMs excel at collecting IOCs, CVE data, and scanning Twitter/dark-web chatter.  
    - Tools like VulScribeR [49] automate vulnerability discovery, while CTIBench [14] evaluates intelligence extraction.  
  - **Penetration Testing**  
    - Frameworks like PentestGPT [52], RapidPen [132], and Autopt [197] show LLMs orchestrating reconnaissance, exploit attempts, and lateral movement.  
    - Multi-agent approaches (Breachseek [19], VulnBot [105], PenHealNet [89]) coordinate specialized sub-agents for higher completion rates.  
  - **Vulnerability Detection**  
    - LProtector [173] and GRACE [122] integrate RAG and structural prompts to detect code/binary flaws, often surpassing rule-based scanners.  
    - LLM-aided triage is especially effective in large codebases (WitheredLeaf [43]).  
  - **Malware Generation**  
    - WormGPT [70] and other demonstration frameworks generate malicious code with minimal user input, customizing TTPs for stealth or polymorphism.  
    - RedCodeAgent [79] highlights the ease of new payload creation, prompting improved automated code scanning.  
  - **Exploitation (One-Day & Zero-Day)**  
    - GPT-4-based systems reproduce ~87% of known exploits if provided CVE details, dropping to ~7% without them [61].  
    - AdbGPT [64] replays and exploits Android bugs automatically, while Vul-RAG [57] links CVE knowledge bases to GPT-4 for advanced patch suggestions.  
  - **Honeypot Deployment**  
    - HoneyLLM [60] and LLMPot [187] demonstrate LLM-driven deception, emulating realistic shells or industrial protocols to ensnare attackers.  
    - They track attacker commands, adapt responses, and feed threat intelligence back to defenders.  
  - **Capture-the-Flag**  
    - HackSynth [131] and EnIGMA [1] benchmark LLM agent performance on CTF challenges. GPT-4 solves a fraction of tasks but struggles with complex binary exploits.

**Lessons for Defenders**  
  - Rotate detection signatures frequently for advanced malware or exploit code.  
  - Deploy LLM honeypots to capture new attacker TTPs.  
  - Integrate continuous security updates, especially in systems prone to one-day or zero-day vulnerabilities.

- **Static-Infrastructure Networks (Section 4, Table 6)**  
  - **6G Core & Radio Access Networks**  
    - LLM-based agents can sabotage 6G by manipulating control-plane APIs and orchestrating real-time cross-domain attacks [175].  
    - 6G’s extreme programmability demands AI-based countermeasures (Nguyen et al. [135]).  
  - **Enterprise Networks**  
    - Automated AD environment compromises [84] highlight how LLM agents chain multiple exploits and privileges.  
    - Zero-trust is crucial for controlling lateral movement.  
  - **Data Centers & SDN**  
    - Patil et al. [147] show LLM-driven zero-day recognition in logs; attackers might repurpose the same to pivot or sow false flags in orchestration.  
    - Bypasses of flow rules or link-flooding remain real threats in SDN [180].  
  - **Smart Grids & Quantum**  
    - LLM-based attacks can falsify grid telemetry (Section 4.5), or exploit classical control in quantum networks (Section 4.6).  
  - **Defensive Strategies**:  
    - AI-based monitoring on each segment of the network.  
    - Strict policy enforcement on control-plane logs, APIs, and identity management.

    - Malicious overlays in XR (SEAR framework [34]) and knowledge poisoning in multi-LLM communities mean new social engineering risks.  
    - Solutions: memory isolation, local verification of agent outputs, and cryptographic identity management.

**Lessons for Defenders**  
  - Cryptographic proofs of identity mitigate Sybil attacks.  
  - Redundancy (routing/storage) for resilience in peer-to-peer networks.  
  - Double-check sensor data in digital twins or immersive overlays with out-of-band signals.
