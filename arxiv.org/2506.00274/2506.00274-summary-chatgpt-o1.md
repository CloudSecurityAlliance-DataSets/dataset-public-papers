- **Context and Motivation**  
  - Large Language Models (LLMs) offer promising applications in digital forensics (DF) and incident response (IR), but concerns about transparency, explainability, and reproducibility limit broader adoption.  
  - The Model Context Protocol (MCP), introduced by Anthropic in late 2024, aims to standardize the way LLMs connect to external tools, enabling more controlled and auditable interactions.  

- **MCP Architecture and Capabilities (Section 2)**  
  - Follows a client–server model:  
    - The “MCP Host” coordinates the LLM and MCP client(s).  
    - The “MCP Client” connects to exactly one MCP Server.  
    - Each “MCP Server” provides well-defined functions (tools) to access specific data or functionality.  
  - Uses JSON-RPC for requests, responses, and notifications. Communication can be over stdin/stdout or HTTP. OAuth 2.1 is optional for authorization in HTTP mode.  
  - Key MCP features:  
    - “Roots” specify the permitted data locations or resources.  
    - “Resources” define accessible data sources (files, images, logs, etc.).  
    - “Tools” describe available operations (e.g., database queries, file parsing).  
    - “Sampling” permits the server to request clarifications from the LLM (with user oversight).  
    - “Prompts” are reusable templates for structured query patterns.  
    - Logging is built-in for auditing each tool invocation.  

- **Inference Constraint Level (Sections 3, 4)**  
  - Concept introduced to describe how much the server constrains an LLM’s interpretive freedom.  
    - High constraint → the MCP server performs most interpretation (e.g., extracting group memberships internally).  
    - Low constraint → the MCP server provides raw data, and the LLM must parse and interpret results itself.  
  - Higher constraint typically increases transparency and reduces hallucinations but can limit flexibility.  

- **Use Cases (Section 3)**  
  1. **Knowledge Database (Section 3.1)**  
     - MCP servers can provide LLMs with structured forensic knowledge from repositories (e.g., SOLVE-IT).  
     - Reduces reliance on static LLM training data and ensures updated references for artifact handling.  
  2. **Artifact Analysis (Section 3.2)**  
     - LLMs can query forensic artifacts (e.g., SQLite databases, registry hives) via MCP servers.  
     - Application-specific MCP servers can parse data, reducing the LLM’s workload and mitigating misinterpretation.  
     - Tools like The Sleuth Kit or Volatility can be wrapped in higher-level MCP functions for more accurate, auditable analyses.  
  3. **Comprehensible Reporting (Section 3.3)**  
     - MCP can integrate multiple data sources (mandates, logs, tool outputs) for automated forensic report generation.  
     - Servers provide robust logging, so each retrieved data fragment is documented.  
     - Improves consistency and traceability in report writing (cf. [13]).  
  4. **Live Analysis and Response (Section 3.4)**  
     - “Agentic” MCP servers can run on endpoints, listing processes, active connections, etc.  
     - LLMs can perform real-time IR actions (e.g., kill processes), though scope must be carefully controlled.  
  5. **Automated Synthetic Data Generation (Section 3.5)**  
     - LLMs can generate training or validation data for forensic tools (e.g., ForTrace++).  
     - MCP servers can provide GUI automation, enabling iterative scenario creation (cf. [16]).  
  6. **Adversary Simulation (Section 3.6)**  
     - MCP can give LLMs access to typical attacker toolkits (network scanners, exploit scripts).  
     - Facilitates AI-driven red teaming and testing advanced defense strategies.  
     - Combined with defensive MCP servers (Section 3.4), can enable closed-loop simulations of attacker–defender dynamics.  

- **Challenges and Considerations (Section 4)**  
  - **Transparency**: Documented tools and detailed MCP logs improve chain-of-custody and reproducibility.  
  - **Forensic Soundness**: MCP servers must not alter evidence unknowingly; both server and tools must be read-only when required.  
  - **Standardization**: Consistent naming and semantics for MCP tools are crucial to ensure reusability and clarity.  
  - **Privacy and Data Protection**: Pseudonymizing sensitive data via the MCP server can enable secure use of hosted LLMs.  
  - **Server Auditing**: MCP servers themselves must be vetted to prevent hidden or malicious functionality.  
  - **Attribution Complexity**: AI-driven programs can perform actions autonomously, complicating user vs. agent accountability. Artifacts like MCP logs become key in investigations.  

- **Conclusion (Section 5)**  
  - MCP offers a path toward more transparent, auditable, and legally defensible AI-assisted forensic processes.  
  - Properly implemented and documented MCP servers can curtail LLM “black-box” issues, aligning with requirements for reproducibility (cf. [4]).  
  - Future work should:  
    - Validate the reliability of LLM–MCP interactions under real forensic conditions.  
    - Develop standardized MCP modules for forensic tasks.  
    - Investigate robust logging and attribution mechanisms to handle the growing complexities of AI-driven system behavior.
