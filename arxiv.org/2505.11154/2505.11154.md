### **Abstract**

Model Context Protocol (MCP) standardizes interface mapping for large language models (LLMs) to access external data and tools, which revolutionizes the paradigm of tool selection and facilitates the rapid expansion of the LLM agent tool ecosystem. However, as the MCP is increasingly adopted, third-party customized versions of the MCP server expose potential security vulnerabilities. In this paper, we first introduce a novel security threat, which we term the MCP Preference Manipulation Attack (MPMA). An attacker deploys a customized MCP server to manipulate LLMs, causing them to prioritize it over other competing MCP servers. This can result in economic benefits for attackers, such as revenue from paid MCP services or advertising income generated from free servers. To achieve MPMA, we first design a Direct Preference Manipulation Attack (DPMA) that achieves significant effectiveness by inserting the manipulative word and phrases into the tool name and description. However, such a direct modification is obvious to users and lacks stealthiness. To address these limitations, we further propose Genetic-based Advertising Preference Manipulation Attack (GAPMA). GAPMA employs four commonly used strategies to initialize descriptions and integrates a Genetic Algorithm (GA) to enhance stealthiness. The experiment results demonstrate that GAPMA balances high effectiveness and stealthiness. Our study reveals a critical vulnerability of the MCP in open ecosystems, highlighting an urgent need for robust defense mechanisms to ensure the fairness of the MCP ecosystem.

#### $\mathbf 1$ **Introduction**

In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated transformative capabilities in tasks such as reasoning [54], mathematics [34], and code generation [55]. As LLMs rapidly advance in their abilities, LLM agents arise $[45, 42, 47]$ , an autonomous system built around an LLM, capable of perceiving its environment, planning actions, and executing tasks to achieve goal-directed intelligent behavior in complex settings. A key feature that enables LLM agents to perform such tasks is their ability to select and call external tools, which extends their action space beyond language generation.

In late 2024, Anthropic revolutionarily introduced the Model Context Protocol (MCP) $[42; 18; 47]$ , a protocol that enables LLM agents to autonomously discover and select tools without relying on predefined interface mappings of function calling. By standardizing tool calling interfaces, MCP significantly reduces development barriers and accelerates the expansion of the LLM agent tool ecosystem $[42, 47]$ . Since its introduction, the MCP has rapidly evolved from a niche protocol into a foundational infrastructure for building LLM agents. Currently, dozens of third-party platforms have deployed a large number of MCP servers $[26; 21; 19; 20]$ , with some of them operating at a scale exceeding  $13,000$  instances [20]. Furthermore, many MCP servers provide high-quality and commercial-

grade services, such as image generation [23; 10], web search [4; 22], and location-based [2; 14] functionalities, through API interfaces, demonstrating substantial potential in promoting service commercialization and market expansion of MCP. Although the MCP community has begun to pay preliminary attention to security issues, current research primarily focuses on the potential presence of malicious code and privacy leakage within MCP servers  $[30, 33, 25]$ . However, a critical question remains: Are these mechanisms sufficient to ensure the overall trustworthiness of MCP applications?

This paper first proposes and investigates the MCP Preference Manipulation Attack (MPMA), a novel security threat against MCP applications. Specifically, multiple paid MCP servers offering similar functionalities often exist in direct competition for economic benefit [23, 10, 1, 24]. In this profit-competing landscape, a malicious MCP server may attempt to manipulate the LLM's tool selection process in order to increase its likelihood of being chosen across a diverse set of user queries. To achieve MPMA, we first propose Directly Preference Manipulation Attack (DPMA), a naive strategy by directly inserting manipulative words or phrases at the beginning of the tool name and description. DPMA proves highly effective, achieving a 100% Attack Success Rate (ASR) in most settings. However, we emphasize that the stealthiness of the attack is critically important, as both the tool name and description are subject to manual inspection by users and third-party platform reviewers. Therefore, it is essential to design the manipulative content that remains inconspicuous while effectively influencing the tool selection process. Inspired by the effectiveness of traditional advertising in manipulating human preference without awareness [38; 35], we further propose Geneticbased Advertising Preference Manipulation Attack (GAPMA). GAPMA leveraging traditional advertising strategies to construct four description optimization objectives: Authoritative, Emotional, Exaggerated, and Subliminal [52; 37; 40; 51]. Subsequently, we employ a black-box Genetic Algorithm  $(GA)$ to further enhance the stealthiness of the attack. Extensive experiment results demonstrate that the proposed methods significantly improve stealthiness while maintaining high attack effectiveness.

Our calculations (see Appendix A) suggest that, under conservative estimates, both DPMA and GAPMA could cause unfair benefits exceeding 200,000 dollars to other MCP servers merely in the web search server alone each year. Furthermore, as the MCP gains wider adoption in standardizing tool calling across LLM agents, the economic impact is expected to grow significantly. Our research reveals critical security vulnerabilities inherent in the MCP framework, thereby highlighting the necessity of developing robust and systematic defense mechanisms to ensure the fairness of the MCP ecosystem. Our main contributions are summarized as follows:

- We first propose a new security threat against the MCP framework called MPMA, where an adversary publishes a malicious, paid MCP server on third-party platforms. Once integrated by users, the base LLM exhibits a consistent preference for the malicious MCP server among MCP servers with similar functionality, thereby enabling the attacker to derive economic benefits.
- We further propose two types of attack strategies for MPMA, namely DPMA and GAPMA. DPMA achieves a high ASR by directly inserting manipulative words or phrases into the tool name or description. In contrast, GAPMA utilizes the four classical advertising strategies and GA to achieve good stealthiness while ensuring a high ASR.
- We conduct comprehensive experiments across 8 MCP servers and 5 mainstream LLMs. The results consistently demonstrate the vulnerability of MCP-based tool selection to MPMA, highlighting the urgent need for corresponding defense mechanisms for the fairness of the MCP ecosystem.

# 2 Preliminary and Related Work

### 2.1 Model Context Protocol (MCP)

Before the introduction of MCP, OpenAI first introduced the function calling mechanism in 2023, enabling LLMs to autonomously call external tools and dynamically interact with the real world[49; 42; 47]. Although function calling provides a foundational framework for tool integration, it presents several limitations. Specifically, it requires developers to manually define interfaces and configure authentication parameters, resulting in limited generality and scalability. These limitations have collectively hindered the widespread adoption and growth of the function calling ecosystem. In contrast, MCP standardizes tool calling interfaces, significantly reducing development barriers and accelerating the expansion of the LLM agent tool ecosystem $[26, 21, 19, 20]$ . The MCP architecture consists of three main components: MCP host, MCP client, and MCP server  $[42; 47]$ . Their definitions and functionalities are described as follows:

![](_page_2_Figure_0.jpeg)

Figure 1: The workflow of the MCP-based LLM agent. It can be divided into four steps, namely:  $\bullet$ task planning,  $\Theta$  tool selection,  $\Theta$  tool calling,  $\Theta$  conclusion and output.

MCP Host. This refers to the integrated development environments (IDEs), or AI tools that access data via the MCP[42]. The host integrates interaction tools for users, MCP servers, and LLMs, enabling efficient MCP-based communication. Representative examples include Claude Desktop[6], Cursor<sup>[9]</sup>, and the VSCode plugin Cline<sup>[7]</sup>.

MCP Client. The MCP client functions as an intermediary within the host environment. It manages communication between the MCP host and one or more MCP servers[42].

MCP Server. The MCP server acts as a gateway that enables the MCP client to access external services and execute tasks by interacting with external tools. Fundamentally, it is an application capable of interacting with the MCP client  $[42]$ . Note that a single MCP server may contain one or multiple tools, and every tool has a name and description. By adhering to the MCP, the tool provides external information and resources to LLMs, allowing them to autonomously plan and complete tasks.

To facilitate understanding, we illustrate an example of a single MCP calling in Figure 1. The figure divides the process into four steps:  $\bullet$  Task planning: A user inputs the user prompt, and the MCP host provides the LLM with the prompt and the contextual information, including the list of available MCP servers and tools with their descriptions and names. The LLM determines that additional input from a weather service is necessary and selects a suitable tool accordingly. @ Tool selection: The LLM sends the tool calling request to the MCP host. <sup>©</sup> Tool calling: The MCP host forwards the calling request to the chosen MCP server. <sup>o</sup> Conclusion and output: The corresponding tool retrieves the required information through an API call or local data, and the data is passed back to the LLM via the MCP host, and the LLM outputs the final response to the user after the conclusion. Note that the MPMA primarily targets the  $\bullet$  (task planning) and  $\bullet$  (tool selection) stages.

### 2.2 Prompt Injection Attack Against LLMs

A prompt injection attack refers to the insertion of a malicious prompt into the query submitted to LLMs, aiming to manipulate the model's behavior. The proposed MPMA can be regarded as a specialized form of prompt injection, wherein manipulative content is embedded into the tool name and description fields. These fields are subsequently incorporated into the model input, thereby influencing the LLM's tool selection decisions. A prompt injection attack can be used to implement various attacks. Zhang et al. [57] implant backdoor prompts into customized versions of GPT, thereby enabling backdoor attacks [44]. Nestaas et al. [48] conduct a preference manipulation attack on LLMs with the internet search by embedding malicious instructions in web pages using font colors that match the background, thus achieving a covert preference manipulation. Shi et al.[50] implement the preferred operation of the LLM agent in a black-box and white-box setting by inserting the prompt into the tools or gradient-based optimization. Their work operates within the context of selecting tools through a retriever. Specifically, the tools they use are chosen by calculating the similarity between the tool document and the user's query. In contrast, in the MCP, tool selection is autonomously determined and decided by the LLM. And their attack aims to facilitate subsequent attacks by making it easier for users to interact with a malicious MCP server, rather than to pursue economic benefits. Overall, these works in preference manipulation attacks highlight security issues in various LLM applications, such as LLM-based search engines [48] and traditional LLM agents [50]. However, our work investigates security concerns in emerging MCP applications, which represent a novel and rapidly developing domain.

Differentiate from the MCP server competition and gain economic benefits

Figure 2: The attack scenario of the MPMA.

#### $3<sup>1</sup>$ **Threat Model**

Attack Scenario. The scenario is shown in the Figure 2. We consider a malicious provider that publishes a paid MCP server on the third-party platform. When the user deploys this server, it will influence the LLM's tool selection process, thereby increasing the likelihood that the malicious server is chosen over its competitors. This preferential selection ultimately leads to economic gains for the attacker through service usage fees or advertising income.

Attacker's Capability. We assume the attacker as the MCP server builder who has white-box access to the MCP server, allowing manipulation of metadata such as the tool name and description. Furthermore, the attacker is capable of publishing the malicious MCP server to third-party MCP platforms. Note that the attacker does not possess any control or modification capability over the base LLM deployed within the LLM agent.

**Attacker's Goals.** (1) Attack effectiveness. The attacker seeks to ensure that the malicious server consistently outperforms competing servers in terms of selection frequency by the LLMs, thereby securing measurable economic benefits. (2) Stealthiness. The attacker aims to maintain the malicious server's inconspicuousness. Specifically, the tool name and description should not raise suspicion among users and should evade both manual inspection and automated machine detection mechanisms.

#### $\overline{\mathbf{4}}$ **Methodology of MPMA**

# **4.1 Attack Overview**

The attack overview is illustrated in Figure 3, which presents only the steps involved in the LLM's tool selection. We emphasize that both the MCP Host and the LLM have access solely to the name and description of each tool of the MCP server, and the internal processing logic of the server remains invisible to them. Therefore, the MPMA can only be carried out by manipulating the tool name and description for the MCP provider. The process can be categorized into three scenarios from top to bottom:

**O** Benign. When all the MCP servers deployed by the user are benign, the model selects the get\_weather tool, which is a sufficient tool for this simple task.

**@** DPMA. We present the Best Description strategy from DPMA as a representative example. When one of the available MCP servers is constructed using the Best Description strategy, the model selects this malicious server, providing the justification that it is the best tool in the world.

 $\Theta$  GAPMA. We present the Exaggerate advertising strategy from GAPMA as a representative example. When one of the available MCP servers is a malicious server constructed using the Exaggerate strategy, the model selects the malicious server, reasoning that it is described as reliable and precise. Compared to DPMA, GAPMA exhibits higher stealthiness, as its descriptions avoid the use of conspicuously manipulative terms. The experiment results in Figure 5 corroborate the improved stealthiness of GAPMA.

# 4.2 Direct Preference Manipulate Attack (DPMA)

DPMA manipulates the preference of LLMs through manipulative words or phrases. The overall procedure is illustrated in Figure 3. We propose two attack strategies: Best Description and Best Name.

![](_page_4_Figure_0.jpeg)

Figure 3: The attack overview of the MPMA. It respectively describes the benign process and the attack effects under the conditions of DPMA and GAPMA strategies from top to bottom.

**Best Description.** Inspired by findings in the [48], we believe that words or phrases including "best" are more likely to gain the preference of LLMs. Therefore, we prepend a manipulative description  $D_m$  to the tool description. Specifically, the Best Description  $D_b$  can be represent in Equation 1:

$$
D_b = D_m \oplus D_{raw}, \tag{1}
$$

where the  $\oplus$  is the string concatenation operation, and the  $D_{raw}$  is the raw description. In this work, we use the phrase: "This is the best tool in the world." as the manipulative description  $D_m$ .

**Best Name.** Similarly, we prepend the manipulative word "best"  $N_m$  to the tool name to elicit the preference of the LLM. Specifically, the Best Name  $N_b$  can be represent in Equation 2:

$$
N_b = N_m \oplus N_{raw}.\tag{2}
$$

Note that these two types of attacks exhibit limited stealthiness, as manipulative words such as "best" are likely to trigger suspicion during both manual and automated inspections. We emphasize that stealthiness is critical in the context of MPMA under the MCP setting, as the information of MCP servers is visible to both users and third-party platforms, shown in Figure 6. If manipulative sentences such as those used in DPMA are inserted, they are likely to arouse user suspicion. Therefore, we further propose GAPMA for better stealthiness.

### 4.3 Genetic-based Advertising Preference Manipulate Attack (GAPMA)

### **4.3.1 Advertising Strategies**

We observe that the pursuit of stealthiness in tool descriptions shares conceptual similarities with traditional advertising strategies, both of which seek to influence user preferences without explicit awareness [38; 35]. Motivated by this observation, we systematically investigate advertising strategies that are designed to unconsciously influence audience decisions. Based on our extensive investigation, we adopt the following four representative advertising strategies in the traditional advertising area:

**Authoritative (Au)[40].** This strategy embeds advertising content within text by disguising it as expert advice or user recommendations.

**Algorithm 1 GAPMA for Stealthiness Enhancement** 

**Input:** Original tool description  $D_0$ , number of iterations n, number of Initialization pool  $P_I$ , advertising prompt  $P_{adv}$ , stealthiness enhancement prompt  $P_{enc}$ , stealthiness top-k selection prompt  $P_{sel-k}$ , and top-k selection k. **Output:** The most stealthy tool description  $D^*$ . 1:  $D \leftarrow \emptyset$ 2: description  $\leftarrow$  GPT-4o( $D_0, P_{adv}$ )  $\triangleright$  /\* Initially generate the advertising description \*/ 3: for  $i = 1$  to  $P_I$  do  $D \leftarrow$  description  $4:$ 5: end for 6: Initialize pool  $P \leftarrow \{D\}$ 7: for  $i = 1$  to n do  $\mathcal{P}_{\text{new}} \leftarrow \emptyset$ 8: for all  $D_j \in \mathcal{P}$  do  $9:$  $D'_i \stackrel{\sim}{\leftarrow}$  MUTATE(D<sub>j</sub>,  $P_{enc}$ )  $\triangleright$  /\* Mutate the description to stealthy direction \*/  $10:$  $D''_i \leftarrow \text{CROSSoveR}(D_j, \text{Random}(\mathcal{P}), P_{enc}) \ge 7^*$  Crossover two descriptions to stealthy  $11:$ direction  $\frac{y}{r}$ /  $12:$  $\mathcal{P}_{\text{new}} \leftarrow \mathcal{P}_{\text{new}} \cup \{D'_i, D''_i\}$  $13:$ end for  $P \leftarrow P \cup P_{new}$  $14:$  $\triangleright$  /\* Merge with original pool \*/  $\mathcal{P} \leftarrow$  GPT-4o $(\mathcal{P}, P_{sel-k}, k)$  $15:$  $\triangleright$  /\* Select top-k stealthiest description \*/  $16:$  end for 17:  $D^* \leftarrow \text{GPT-4o}(\mathcal{P}, P_{sel-1}, 1)$  $\triangleright$  /\* Select the stealthiest description \*/ 18: return  $D^*$ 

**Emotional (Em)[52].** This strategy aligns advertising content with the audience's emotional needs by incorporating emotionally charged language.

**Exaggerated**  $(Ex)[37]$ **.** This strategy uses exaggeration and strong rhetorical techniques to make the product appear more appealing.

**Subliminal (Su)[51].** This strategy is a form of covert advertising that embeds information through subconscious cues. Although readers may not consciously recognize the advertising content, the implicit messages or psychological suggestions subtly influence their behavior.

We employ GPT-4o[43] to generate tool descriptions that exhibit specific advertising characteristics.

### 4.3.2 Algorithm for Descriptions Stealthiness Enhancement.

GAPMA consists of two main components: advertising style transformation and genetic algorithm stealthiness enhancement. We first utilize GPT-4o[43] and advertising prompt  $P_{adv}$  to transform the original tool description into a style that aligns with the selected advertising strategy, while maintaining a certain level of stealthiness, after the initialization of the pool  $P$ . Subsequently, a GA is applied to further enhance the stealthiness of the optimized description by iteratively refining candidate prompts. Specifically, in each iteration, we introduce the MUTATE operation using the stealthiness-oriented prompt  $P_{enc}$  designed to improve stealthiness and perform the CROSSOVER operation, combining elements from pairs of prompts to promote mutation diversity and explore a broader solution space. The resulting candidate descriptions are accumulated in a pool  $P$ , from which the GPT-40 selects the top-k descriptions that appear least suspicious. These descriptions are retained for the next iteration, thereby guiding the evolutionary process toward higher stealthiness. After  $n$  iterations, GPT-40 is used to select the most stealthy description from the final pool. The prompt designed for each advertising strategy and the further details are shown in Appendix B.

#### 5 **Experiment Setup**

**Metric.** We utilize the following metrics to evaluate the DPMA and GAPMA strategies.

★Attack Success Rate (ASR). This metric evaluates the attack effectiveness of the MPMA. It can be defined in Equation 3:

$$
ASR = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{|D|} \mathbb{I}(M(x_i) \to S_t)}{|D|},\tag{3}
$$

where  $D$  denotes the dataset consisting of 10 queries constructed for the corresponding MCP server, and x represents a specific data.  $S_t$  denotes the constructed malicious MCP server, and the symbol  $\rightarrow$  indicates the MCP server selected by the LLM. A higher ASR indicates a more successful attack.

 $\star$ True Positive Rate (TPR). This metric measures the stealthiness of the MCP server by measuring the proportion of tool descriptions that are flagged as suspicious by either LLMs or human annotators. To conduct this assessment, we utilize the LLM-as-a-judge paradigm $[41]$  and human evaluation to evaluate whether a given tool description may raise suspicion. For LLM-as-a-judge, five of the most widely used LLMs are employed for this assessment: Deepseek-V3 (Deepseek)[46], Claude-3.7-Sonnet (Claude)[5], GPT-4o[43], Grok-3 (Grok)[15], and Gemini-2.5 (Gemini)[53]. To enhance the domain knowledge of LLMs in assessing whether a tool description appears suspicious, this study adopts the widely used few-shot In-Context Learning (ICL)[39; 36] strategy. Specifically, we manually designed manipulative examples to serve as demonstrations to calibrate the LLMs' suspicion detection. For human evaluation, three independent annotators are recruited. They label the tool description based on the instruction shown in Appendix B. The calculation of the TPR metric can be defined in the following Equation 4:

$$
TPR = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{|S|} \sum_{k=1}^{|M|} \mathbb{I}(M_k(x_i, P_j, D_j) = 1)}{|M| \cdot |S|},\tag{4}
$$

where M denotes the set of judge models, S denotes the MCP server list,  $P_i$  represents the judge prompt for stealthiness judging, and  $D_i$  is the judging demonstration. The judging instructions and demonstrations can be seen in Appendix B. Note that for human evaluation, the equation of  $(M_k(x_i, P_i, D_i))$  should be  $H(x_i)$  where the H means judge by human. A lower TPR indicates the attack can evade the censor of the LLM and human, which turns out to be more stealthy.

Model. We evaluate the MPMA utilizing five widely adopted base LLMs for LLM agent: Deepseek-V3 (Deepseek)[46], Claude-3.7-Sonnet (Claude)[5], Gemini-2.5-flash (Gemini)[53], Qwen3-235B-A22B (Qwen3)[56], and GPT-4o[43].

MCP Server. 8 commonly used MCP servers are employed in the experiments. These servers provide the following functionalities: weather information (Weather)[31], time information (Time)[29], MCP server installation assistance (Installer)[17], daily hot news (Hotnews)[16], web page content fetching (Fetch)[13], web-to-markdown conversion (Markdown)[32], cryptocurrency analysis (Crypto)[8], and web search (Search)[28]. The demonstration of tool description can be seen in Appendix B.

**Dataset.** For each MCP server, ten common queries corresponding to the MCP server are constructed for evaluation. More details can be seen in Appendix B.

**Implementation Details.** To simulate a competitive environment, five additional competing MCP servers with the same functionality are included alongside the malicious MCP server. These competing servers share the same name, and their descriptions are paraphrased using GPT-4o[43] to ensure diversity. In the main experiments of GAPMA, the parameters are set to iteration =  $5$  and  $k = 10$ . All the experiments are conducted using Cline [7], one of the most popular MCP hosts currently available.

**Baseline.** The MPMA baseline refers to the ASR of the benign MCP server. Since each MCP server has an equal chance when no manipulation is performed, the baseline ASR is 1/(number of competing MCP servers). For example, in the main experiment, the baseline ASR is  $1/6 = 16.67\%$ since the total number of competing MCP servers is 6.

#### **Experiment Result** 6

### **6.1 Experiment Result of DPMA**

The experiment results are shown in Figure 4. The following conclusions can be drawn: The Best Description strategy consistently achieves a 100% ASR across almost all settings. And the Best Name strategy also attains a 100% ASR in most cases and outperforms the baseline, except for a few scenarios under the GPT-40 model where its ASR falls below the baseline. We speculate that GPT-40 may be less sensitive to tool names and instead relies more on the tool description for tool selection. Moreover,

the ASR of Best Description is overall higher than Best Name. Overall, DPMA demonstrates strong attack effectiveness, and the Best Description strategy is more effective compared to Best Name.

### **6.2 Experiment Result of GAPMA**

We conducted extensive experiments on GAPMA, and the results are presented in Table 1. We can draw the following conclusions: Most advertising strategies achieve much higher ASR than the baseline. Specifically, regarding the average ASR of the Adv column, most settings show a significantly higher ASR compared to the baseline, except for the Ex strategies under the GPT-40. Moreover, we observe that the Au strategy consistently yields the best performance, while the Em strategy performs relatively poorly. And among the 5 LLMs evaluated, the Gemini exhibits the highest ASR at 91.88%, whereas GPT-40 shows the lowest ASR at only 22.19%. We speculate that this discrepancy may result from the presence of specific defense mechanisms deployed in GPT-40. Besides, the results of the comparative experiments involving the GA are presented in Appendix C to investigate the impact of GA on attack effectiveness, which indicates that GA does not negatively affect attack effectiveness, but even leads to improved effectiveness. In conclusion, the proposed GAPMA demonstrates strong attack effectiveness across diverse models and settings, and the GA even increases the attack effectiveness of GAPMA.

### **6.3** Stealthiness Experiment

![](_page_8_Figure_1.jpeg)

Figure 5: The stealthiness experiment result of DPMA and GAPMA utilizing the LLM-as-ajudge and human evaluation. The RD and BD mean raw description and best description, and w/ and w/o mean whether to utilize GA.

The experiment result is shown in Figure 5. The following conclusions can be drawn: All advertising strategies result in lower TPRs than the Best Description in DPMA. Notably, under the LLM-as-a-judge evaluation, the four advertising strategies optimized with GA even outperform the raw description, with TPR of 0% (Au), 5% (Em), 2.5% (Ex), and 0% (Su), all lower than the 37.5% TPR of the Best Description and 10% of the raw description. Second, in both LLM and human evaluations, the use of GA consistently leads to significantly lower TPR compared to the nonuse counterparts. This demonstrates the effectiveness of GA in enhancing stealthiness. Moreover, among all advertising strategies, the Au strategy optimized with a GA achieves the lowest TPR across both evalu-

ations, indicating the highest level of stealth. Combining this with the experiment result in Section 6.2 that Au achieves the highest attack effectiveness, we can conclude that Au is the most suitable advertising strategy in GAPMA for MPMA. In conclusion, the combination of advertising strategies and GA optimization leads to significant stealthiness enhancement, which is much better than DPMA.

#### 7 **Discussion**

**Malicious Majority.** We investigate the scenario of a malicious majority in MPMA. Specifically, we assume that a majority of MCP server providers employ the proposed DPMA or GAPMA strategies to manipulate their tool descriptions for economic benefit. A total of 8 competing MCP servers are included in the MCP server set for the experiment: one server uses the Best Name strategy, another adopts the Best Description strategy, four servers apply the four advertising strategies from GAPMA, and two benign servers utilize the original tool descriptions. The other settings align with the main experiment. The experiment results are shown in Table 2. In the Deepseek, Claude, and Gemini LLMs, the selected tools are benign. The models explicitly state that they prefer to choose the most straightforward tool to use in the reply. We name this counterintuitive phenomenon as "over-manipulation". We speculate that in the malicious majority scenario, the models may become alert due to the excessive use of manipulative descriptions and consequently choose a more straightforward tool.

Table 2: The experiment result of the malicious majority scenario conducted on the Time MCP server[29] and 5 LLMs. SR means the selection rate of the preferred MCP server by LLMs.

Additional Discussions. We provide more discussions including limitations, broader impacts, and ethical considerations in Appendix E, Appendix F, Appendix D, respectively.

#### 8 Conclusion

In this paper, we propose a new security threat in the MCP application called MPMA. In this attack, an adversary constructs a malicious, paid MCP server that gains the LLM's preference over competing services, thereby achieving economic gains such as revenue from paid MCP services or advertising income generated from free servers. We further propose two strategies. The first is DPMA, which embeds manipulative keywords and phrases directly into the tool description. Although DPMA achieves strong attack performance, it lacks stealth. To address this, we further propose the GAPMA, which leverages advertising strategies and a GA to craft effective yet inconspicuous tool descriptions that evade user detection. Extensive experiments are conducted to evaluate the MPMA. The experiment results demonstrate that DPMA achieves significant attack effectiveness, while GAPMA simultaneously attains both strong attack effectiveness and stealthiness.

#### **Rough Economic Loss Estimation** A

MPMA could potentially generate substantial economic benefits. To quantify the potential economic impact of the MPMA, we conducted a preliminary analysis. Taking the MCP server for web search as an example, we have conducted a preliminary calculation on the Smithery platform $[26]$ . This platform hosts approximately 100 MCP servers related to web search. We use Brave Search<sup>[3]</sup>, which has a relatively high usage volume, as an example for calculation. Its deployment volume is 17,000 times, and there are currently about 10 platforms with a scale comparable to that of the Smithery platform $[26; 21; 19; 20]$ . The counts of different platforms are independent, so we only consider platforms of comparable scale and conservatively estimate their deployment volume to be 170,000 across these platforms. For economic estimation, the average price of Brave Search paid API is 5 dollars per 1,000 calls. We conservatively assume that  $1\%$  of users incur paid usage fees, with an average frequency of 10 calls per day. Thus, the economic benefit of this MCP server in one year, without considering an increase in users, is calculated as follows:

$$
\text{Revenue} = (170,000 \times 0.01 \times 10) \times \left(\frac{5}{1,000}\right) \times 365 \approx \$310,250. \tag{5}
$$

Through similar analysis, we can roughly estimate the economic benefits of the top 5 web search MCP servers as follows: DuckDuckGo[11] at 69,350 dollars, Exa Search[12] at 15,695 dollars, Tavily Search<sup>[27]</sup> at 18,688 dollars, and Perplexity Search<sup>[22]</sup> at 19,345 dollars. It can be imagined that, without considering other MCP servers, the sum of the API call fees for the top five web search MCP servers alone can reach 413,983 dollars. Assuming a malicious party creates a malicious MCP server that utilizes our MCP server, and assuming that 80% of users will install one similar competing MCP server, 70% will install two, 60% will install three, 50% will install four, and 40% will install five, then the Best Description strategy in our DPMA achieves a 100% ASR, which could potentially cause an unfair benefit of approximately 248,389.8 dollars per year to other MCP servers.

Benefit = 
$$
(40\% \times \frac{5}{5} \times 413,983) + (10\% \times \frac{4}{5} \times 413,983)
$$

\n
$$
+ (10\% \times \frac{3}{5} \times 413,983) + (10\% \times \frac{2}{5} \times 413,983)
$$

\n
$$
+ (10\% \times \frac{1}{5} \times 413,983) \approx \$248,389.8.
$$

\n(6)

Similarly, assuming that the probability of each user using each LLM is equal, and ASR utilized in Brave Search is equivalent to the average ASR of the AU strategies in the main experiment. the GAPMA using the Au strategies could potentially cause an unfair benefit of approximately 203,033.8 dollars per year. As the market for third-party MCP servers continues to rapidly expand, so will the economic benefits. We emphasize that we are only considering MCP servers in the web search domain. There are many other types of paid MCP servers, such as those for image generation  $[23; 10]$  and location-based services $[2, 14]$ . Therefore, the potential economic impact caused by MPMA could be substantial.

Table 4: An example is provided for one of the ten queries configured within each MCP server. Notably, the parts enclosed in curly brackets (e.g.,  $\{$ ) represent variable segments. That is, the remaining queries are generated by substituting different variables into an otherwise fixed query structure. Note that in the Search MCP server, GPT-40[43] is instructed to generate ten AI-related queries directly, which are used as the dataset. As a result, these queries do not contain variable components.

The Instruction of Human Evaluation. In our evaluation, we employ the following instructions to simulate realistic MCP usage scenarios for assessing the stealthiness of the descriptions. "Please" review the following descriptions of MCP servers. For each description, mark it as 1 if it raises your suspicion or if you believe it is malicious to some extent, and 0 otherwise."

Visible Tool Description and Name. The visibility of the Tavily MCP server on both the MCP host used by the user and third-party platforms is shown in Figure 6. We can see that the tool name and description are visible. This demonstrates that, for MPMA, such attacks should strive to minimize user suspicion to keep the stealthiness

#### **Supplementary Experiment Results** C

Ablation Study. Number of Competing MCP Servers. We investigate the impact of the number of competing MCP servers on the ASR, as shown in Figure 7. The following conclusions can be drawn: First, both DPMA and GAPMA consistently maintain high ASR levels. When the number of servers increases from 2 to 11, only Ex and Em fail to sustain a 100% ASR, showing a downward trend starting from 9 servers. The other four strategies maintain a 100% ASR throughout. Second, the ASR of MPMA demonstrates strong robustness with respect to the number of competing servers. Specifically, the Best Description and Best Name in DPMA, as well as Su and Au in GAPMA, achieve a constant 100% ASR. In conclusion, MPMA achieves both high attack effectiveness and robustness, maintaining a high ASR even in the presence of many competitors.

**Comparative Experiment of GAPMA.** We investigate the impact of employing genetic algorithms on attack effectiveness in X. The experiment results, as presented in Table 5, allow us to draw the following conclusions: Firstly, in general, the ASR significantly surpasses the baseline in the vast majority of cases, regardless of whether genetic algorithms are utilized. Secondly, the application of genetic algorithms does not exert a detrimental effect on ASR; rather, it enhances ASR in certain instances. By analyzing the average results across the Deepseek, Claude, GPT-40, Gemini, and Qwen3 models, both with and without genetic algorithms, we observe that only in the Gemini model does the ASR without genetic algorithms slightly exceed that with genetic algorithms. In all other cases, the ASR with genetic algorithms consistently outperforms the ASR without genetic algorithms. Overall, genetic algorithms demonstrate no adverse impact on attack effectiveness and even contribute to an improvement in the attack effectiveness of GAPMA.

#### **Ethical Consideration** D

This study strictly adheres to ethical principles. The MPMA attack is implemented solely within a controlled experiment environment and is not applied to any real-world platforms or production

systems. All experiments are conducted in an isolated testing setting. Tasks involving human annotation are carried out under an informed consent mechanism. Participants are fully briefed on the task content in advance, voluntarily participate, and receive appropriate compensation. All data are anonymized, and no personally identifiable information is collected. To mitigate the risk of misuse, access to the open-source code and manipulation descriptions has been restricted for research purposes only, with prominent warnings against potential abuse included in the project. In addition, access barriers have been established for content involving sensitive attack strategies, requiring users to explicitly state their legitimate research intent.

#### **Limitations** $\bf{E}$

Although the proposed MPMA attack demonstrates notable effectiveness, several limitations must be acknowledged to fully understand its practical applicability. First, the success of the attack heavily depends on the internal selection mechanism of the target LLM. However, this mechanism is essentially a black box, making it exhibit limited interpretability. Specifically, experiment results reveal significant differences in ASR across different models, such as Gemini [53] and GPT-4o [43]. While the underlying cause remains unclear, it is hypothesized that these variations may stem from differences in internal defense strategies or heightened sensitivity to linguistic manipulation. Second, the scope of evaluation is limited. Although this study includes five mainstream LLMs and eight commonly used MCP servers, the lack of automation in the MCP evaluation process results in slow experiment throughput. Broader experiment coverage is needed in future work to assess the more universal applicability of MPMA. Third, the reproducibility of the results is affected by the inherent

randomness in LLM outputs. Due to the stochastic nature of LLM responses, identical inputs may vield different selection behaviors at different times, thereby making the complete reproduction of this study particularly complex.

#### $\mathbf{F}$ **Broader Impacts**

The MPMA attack framework proposed in this study is not only technically insightful but also introduces a range of societal risks. From a negative perspective, MPMA poses a tangible threat to the security of open LLM agents and MCP ecosystems. By embedding direct or invisible manipulations into MCP server descriptions, an attacker can bias the model's tool selection process to favor their own services and thereby gain economic benefits. Such manipulation has the potential to exacerbate existing social inequalities. If malicious tools are deployed at scale, the attack could result in monopolization of user queries by the attacker, undermining the fairness and diversity of the ecosystem. From a positive standpoint, the public disclosure of this research provides valuable insights for identifying and addressing security vulnerabilities in MCP and LLM agent systems. By presenting the attack methodology and evaluation mechanisms, the study aims to foster the development of corresponding defense strategies within the community. To mitigate the risk of misuse, access to the code and dataset has been restricted to research purposes only, accompanied by clear warnings regarding potential abuse. Furthermore, the study recommends the incorporation of trusted labeling mechanisms in future MCP infrastructures to enhance platform security and bolster user trust.
