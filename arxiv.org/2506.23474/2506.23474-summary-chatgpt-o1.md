## Summary of "A Large-Scale Evolvable Dataset for Model Context Protocol Ecosystem and Security Analysis"

- **Overview and Motivation**  
  - Proposes MCPCORPUS, a large-scale dataset focused on the rapidly growing Model Context Protocol (MCP) ecosystem.  
  - Addresses ecosystem challenges in standardization, reliability, security, and interoperability by providing unified, annotated metadata.  
  - Covers around 14K MCP servers and 300 MCP clients drawn from MCP.so and GitHub.

- **Dataset Composition**  
  - Includes over 20 structured attributes (Table 1) per MCP artifact, combining:  
    - Basic descriptors (e.g., name, description, author).  
    - Interface/configuration details (e.g., tools, server commands, environment).  
    - GitHub signals (e.g., stars, forks, open issues, contributors).  
    - GitHub metadata (e.g., primary language, license, archived status).  
  - Each record is stored in JSONL format, enabling easy programmatic access and analysis.

- **Data Sources and Collection** (Section 2)  
  - **MCP.so**: Largest registry of MCP servers/clients, providing core metadata (e.g., domain tags, author info).  
  - **GitHub**: Enriches each artifact with repository-level metrics (e.g., star count, license) and indications of activity (e.g., commit history).  
  - **Crawling & Normalization Pipeline** (Figure 1):  
    1. Registry crawling from MCP.so.  
    2. GitHub API enrichment.  
    3. Cleaning and deduplication (removing invalid or duplicate entries).  
    4. Metadata normalization into a unified schema.  
    5. Classification and indexing along key dimensions (e.g., server/client, language).

- **Key Attributes and Schema** (Section 3)  
  - Unified metadata schema with up to 26 fields per artifact, facilitating analysis of:  
    - **Artifact identity & domain** (e.g., category, tags).  
    - **Interface details** (e.g., tools, server_config).  
    - **Popularity & maintenance** (e.g., stargazers_count, last_commit).  
    - **Technical structure** (e.g., languages, has_docker, license).  
  - Figure 2 provides a concrete example (playwright-mcp), showing how registry and GitHub data are merged.

- **Statistical Insights**  
  - **Star Distribution** (Figure 3): Highly skewed long-tail; most MCP projects have <10 stars, with a small subset exceeding 500+ stars.  
  - **Language Distribution** (Figure 4): Python, TypeScript, and JavaScript dominate among both servers and clients; Go, Rust, Java, C# appear less frequently.  
  - Highlights a quickly expanding ecosystem with many small projects and a few highly popular ones.

- **Application Scenarios** (Section 4)  
  1. **Ecosystem Analysis**  
     - Enables longitudinal tracking of MCP growth and health.  
     - Standardized fields support deeper research into adoption trends, license usage, and development activity.  
     - Can identify under-maintained or heavily centralized MCP artifacts.  
  2. **Security and Code Quality Assessment**  
     - Interface definitions (server_command, server_config) can reveal surface areas for security risk analysis.  
     - GitHub signals indicate trustworthiness and maintenance (e.g., forks_count, has_docker).  
     - Facilitates large-scale auditing of protocol conformance, code quality, and potential vulnerabilities.

- **Conclusions and Future Directions** (Section 5)  
  - MCPCORPUS provides a reproducible snapshot of the MCP ecosystem, lowering the barrier for research on reliability, security, and integration.  
  - Public release encourages further explorations of multi-language interoperability, secure MCP development, and consistent tool-augmented LLM research.  
  - Future dataset iterations aim to maintain comprehensive coverage and enhance annotation granularity (e.g., more interface types, deeper officiality checks).

- **References**  
  - Supports studies on protocol standardization [1,10], security threats [2,3,4,11], and real-world MCP usage [5,6].  
  - Demonstrates synergy between open-source repositories and platform-driven registries for ecosystem-scale insights.
