**Summary of “Model Context Protocol (MCP) at First Glance: Studying the Security and Maintainability of MCP Servers”**

- **Context & Motivation**  
  - Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a standardized client-server protocol enabling AI applications to discover and invoke external “tools.”  
  - It addresses interoperability challenges caused by siloed AI frameworks (e.g., each having its own custom tool interface).  
  - Rapid industry adoption (over eight million weekly SDK downloads) drives the need to assess health, security vulnerabilities, and maintainability of MCP servers.

- **Research Scope & Dataset**  
  - First large-scale empirical study of 1,899 open-source MCP servers (343 from official listings [105], plus 1,556 mined from GitHub).  
  - Analyzed health/sustainability (e.g., commit frequency, contributor metrics), security vulnerabilities, and maintainability issues (code smells, bugs).  
  - Utilized a hybrid analysis approach:  
    1. SonarQube for general vulnerabilities, code smells, and bugs.  
    2. mcp-scan for MCP-specific vulnerabilities (e.g., tool poisoning).  
    3. Literature baselines from OSS ecosystems (PyPI, NPM, ML codebases).

### 1. Health & Sustainability (RQ-0)

- **Indicators & Comparisons**  
  - Evaluated 14 repository-level metrics (commit frequency, CI adoption, issue responsiveness, etc.).  
  - Compared metrics against general OSS and ML domains.
- **Key Observations**  
  - **Commit Frequency**: MCP servers have a median of 5.5 commits/week vs. ~2.5 in general OSS.  
  - **CI Adoption**: 42.2% use CI, slightly exceeding general OSS (40.3%) and ML (37.2%).  
  - **Growth Trajectory**: Normalized (per-year) star and fork counts exceed baselines, reflecting rapid “early-stage” adoption.  
  - **Integration Types**: “Mined” MCP servers have higher commit counts and larger codebases than “official” or “community” servers, suggesting greater development activity.

**Conclusion**: MCP servers show strong early-stage sustainability, with active development and community engagement.

### 2. Security Vulnerabilities (RQ-1)

- **Approach**  
  - Used SonarQube to detect general vulnerabilities; enumerated patterns via CWE mappings.  
  - Applied the mcp-scan tool on a sample to detect MCP-specific issues (notably tool poisoning).
- **Findings**  
  - **Prevalence**: 7.2% of MCP servers have at least one general vulnerability (eight distinct patterns).  
  - **Most Common**:  
    - **Credential Exposure (3.6%)**—hardcoded API keys (e.g., OpenAI, Google Cloud) and GitHub tokens.  
    - Lack of Access Control (1.4%), CORS issues (1.2%), Tool Poisoning (5.5%) found by mcp-scan.  
  - **Overlap**: Only three vulnerability types overlap with known patterns in PyPI or IaC (e.g., authentication issues, input validation).  
  - **Tool Poisoning**: MCP-specific vulnerability edging upward, demonstrates the need for domain-focused tools.  
  - **Integration Type**: Official MCP servers showed zero issues in SonarQube scans, while community/mined have multiple vulnerabilities.

**Conclusion**: MCP servers display unique security weaknesses—especially credential leakage and tool poisoning—that are underdetected by traditional scanners, underscoring the need for MCP-specific security solutions.

### 3. Maintainability (RQ-2)

- **Code Smells**  
  - 66% of MCP servers contain at least one “critical” or “blocker” smell.  
  - **High Cognitive Complexity (59.7%)** is the most frequent and severe, correlating with difficult-to-maintain code.  
  - Other top smells align with known issues in traditional Python/JavaScript (e.g., duplication, function structure problems).  
  - Mined MCP servers carry ~66% more smells than official/community servers.

- **Bugs**  
  - 14.4% of servers exhibit at least one statically detected bug; nine distinct categories identified.  
  - Common bugs include array manipulation errors, parameter mismatches, and type/structure issues.  
  - Some bug patterns overlap with known Java/Python/JS ecosystems, suggesting existing debugging techniques are reusable.  
  - Mined MCP servers again show higher bug counts.

**Conclusion**: Although MCP servers are new, they inherit classic code smells/bugs. Established SE refactoring/debugging approaches apply but must adapt to MCP’s fast-evolving nature.

### 4. Implications

- **For Researchers**  
  - Extend vulnerability databases (e.g., CWE, OWASP) to include MCP-specific threats like tool poisoning.  
  - Develop robust MCP-focused security analyzers combining static/dynamic analysis to detect evolving vulnerabilities.
- **For Practitioners (Developers & Users)**  
  - Practice secure coding and CI-based scanning to mitigate credential leaks.  
  - Adopt LLM-based refactoring and bug detection tools: code smells and bug patterns in MCP servers mirror known software engineering issues.  
  - Audit third-party MCP servers (e.g., SonarQube + mcp-scan) before deployment—particularly for tool poisoning risks.
- **For Ecosystem Maintainers**  
  - Incorporate standardized submission guidelines and automated scanning in MCP registries (e.g., Cloudflare Workers, Smithery).  
  - Implement governance protocols (e.g., permission disclosures, revocation) to prevent insecure MCP servers from propagating vulnerabilities.

### 5. Conclusion

- MCP servers exhibit promising sustainability, evidenced by high commit frequency and rapid community growth.  
- Security vulnerabilities are more specialized (credential exposure, tool poisoning, transport issues), indicating a need for dedicated MCP security tooling.  
- Maintainability concerns resemble classic OSS patterns; ~66% show severe code smells, ~14% show bugs.  
- Future work includes strengthening MCP-specific vulnerability detection, establishing ecosystem governance, and leveraging advanced refactoring systems for robust, maintainable MCP infrastructure.
