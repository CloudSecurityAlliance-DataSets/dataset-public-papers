I’ll conduct a thorough analysis of the paper, focusing on the correctness and truthfulness of its claims, particularly regarding AI agency and ethics. The critique will evaluate the logical coherence, technical accuracy, and ethical considerations presented. I’ll also assess whether the paper fairly represents current AI developments and aligns with established literature.

Once I have completed the assessment, I’ll present a structured critique detailing the strengths, weaknesses, and areas for improvement. I’ll notify you when it’s ready for review.

Critique of “Fully Autonomous AI Agents Should Not be Developed”

Correctness & Truthfulness of Claims
	•	Core Claim – Increasing Autonomy Increases Risk: The paper’s central claim is that as AI agents gain more autonomy, the potential risks to people grow ￼. This premise is logically plausible – if a user hands over more control to an automated system, errors or misaligned actions can scale up unchecked. The authors correctly note that “the more control a user cedes to an AI agent, the more risks to people arise,” with safety risks being “particularly concerning” ￼. In principle, this aligns with known issues in automation (e.g. autopilot failures or automated trading errors compounding quickly).
	•	Lack of Empirical Evidence: A weakness is that the paper leans heavily on theoretical scenarios and historical analogies rather than concrete data from current AI agents. For instance, it cites past “close calls” like the 1980 nuclear missile false alarm as cautionary tales, implying AI mistakes could be similarly catastrophic. Such analogies are evocative but hyperbolic – autonomous software agents today do not operate nuclear arsenals, and comparing a coding agent’s mistake to a nuclear mishap is misleading ￼. The paper’s worries about “cascading errors” in multi-step agents and “unbounded inaccuracies” in fully autonomous agents are presented speculatively ￼. While it’s logically possible that an unsupervised AI could compound mistakes (one error leading to another), no empirical case is provided. This lack of real-world evidence or case studies (e.g. failures from actual autonomous agent deployments) weakens the factual grounding of the arguments. Hypotheticals dominate, so the reader is asked to accept the authors’ foresight rather than documented truth.
	•	Accuracy of Risk Descriptions: Many risks the authors enumerate (safety hazards, security breaches, privacy invasion, etc.) are genuine concerns. They correctly identify issues like misplaced trust in AI systems, which can indeed cause a “snowball effect of yet further harms” if an unreliable agent is trusted with more power ￼. However, some risks might be overstated. For example, the paper suggests a “fully autonomous” agent could produce outcomes “wholly unaligned with human goals” ￼. This echoes fears of objective misalignment akin to sci-fi or AGI scenarios, which might misrepresent current technology. Present AI agents (based on LLMs) do make mistakes or pursue unintended sub-tasks, but to claim they could pursue goals entirely orthogonal to any human intent verges on assuming a level of agency and general intelligence that AI systems do not yet possess. In summary, the claims are logically conceivable but sometimes not clearly bounded by today’s technological reality, making the argument truthful in theory but debatably speculative in practice.
	•	Support and Evidence: The logical structure of “more autonomy ⇒ more risk” is supported qualitatively (e.g. the authors cite how letting AI execute code freely could lead to dangerous actions ￼). Yet, the paper provides few quantitative measures or real incidents to support how much risk increases, or which specific failure modes are likely. This limits the truthfulness insofar as we must trust the authors’ risk estimates. In places, one could accuse the paper of cherry-picking worst-case possibilities without acknowledging how low-probability or avoidable some may be. For example, the fear that a coding agent can “override all human control” ￼ assumes no safety interlocks or sandboxing, which is not a given. A more truthful discussion would specify the conditions under which an AI could truly escape human control (e.g. poor security or oversight) versus scenarios where humans can easily pull the plug. Omitting these details paints autonomy as invariably catastrophic, which isn’t an entirely fair representation of the truth.

Technical Accuracy (Definitions & Taxonomy)
	•	Definition of AI Agency: The authors define an “AI agent” broadly as a system that, given a goal, can “decompose it into subtasks and execute each without direct human intervention.” ￼ This description is generally accurate and reflects the common understanding of agentic AI (e.g. an AutoGPT-style loop that plans and acts iteratively). They rightly note there is “no clear consensus” on the term, but highlight autonomy and goal-directed behavior as key traits ￼. This framing is technically sound and sets the stage for discussing degrees of autonomy.
	•	Levels of Autonomy – Clarity vs. Oversimplification: A significant portion of the paper is spent classifying AI agents into different levels or gradations of autonomy (presented in Table 1). The intent is to mirror how autonomous vehicles have levels (L0 to L5), by defining something like: minimal autonomy (simple single-step tools), intermediate “semi-autonomous” agents, up to “fully autonomous” agents. This taxonomy is helpful for structuring the discussion – it forces clarity on what “fully autonomous” means in context (the paper essentially defines a fully autonomous agent as one that can “write and execute its own code” without pre-defined limits ￼). The level-based approach provides a heuristic language for comparing systems and is a useful pedagogical tool ￼. For example, the paper distinguishes a “Multi-step” agent from a “Fully Autonomous” agent by noting that the latter is not bounded by the developer’s predefined actions at all – it can generate entirely new actions/code on the fly ￼.
	•	Validity of the Five-Level Taxonomy: Despite its clarity, the proposed autonomy spectrum appears overly rigid. Real AI systems don’t always fit neatly into five bins. The paper lumps complex architectures into discrete levels, which can mischaracterize current architectures. For instance, it describes a “Simple → Tool Call” agent (presumably a basic LLM that can call a tool) and warns that an error at this level might select the wrong tool due to an inaccurate output ￼. It then describes a “Multi-step” agent (one that iteratively calls itself or tools) and notes “cascading errors” as the compounding risk there ￼. Finally, the “Fully Autonomous” level (level 5) is an agent that can “create code [from a user request] and execute it” without any human oversight, carrying the risk of producing outcomes “wholly unaligned with human goals.” ￼. While these distinctions (single-step vs. multi-step vs. code-writing) are conceptually reasonable, in practice the boundaries blur. Many systems today blend levels – for example, a semi-autonomous car or an AI assistant might handle tasks autonomously until human intervention is needed, straddling “multi-step” and “semi-autonomous” categories. The framework doesn’t clearly account for such hybrid control systems. In technical reality, autonomy exists on a continuous spectrum and along multiple dimensions (degree of human oversight, ability to self-modify, scope of action domain, etc.), not a simple ladder. The paper’s level scheme is a simplification that, while useful for debate, might be too coarse to describe nuanced AI behaviors ￼. This could mislead readers into thinking there are hard thresholds (e.g. a system is either fully autonomous or not) when many AI agents occupy a gray area.
	•	Clarity of “Fully Autonomous” Definition: The paper’s definition of full autonomy – agents that can operate “beyond constrained code options controlled by the developer” ￼ – captures the idea of an AI that can basically do anything it decides, not just a fixed set of programmed actions. This is a reasonable attempt to define the elusive “level 5”. However, it is somewhat vague in technical terms. All AI runs on some computer and thus has constraints (e.g. hardware limits, sandboxed environments, pre-set APIs). It’s unclear where the line is drawn. For example: if an agent can compose new tool combinations but cannot execute arbitrary OS commands, is it “beyond predefined constraints” or not? The definition could be interpreted in multiple ways, which might cause confusion. A more operational definition (perhaps specifying that a fully autonomous agent can generate novel code to pursue a high-level goal and execute that code autonomously, without a human vetting each step) would pin it down better. As it stands, the distinction between a very advanced semi-autonomous agent and a “truly” fully autonomous agent rests on this fuzzy notion of operating beyond the developer’s foresight. This technical ambiguity is noted by critics as well ￼.
	•	Agency and Intentionality: The paper briefly touches on whether AI agents truly have intentions or agency in a philosophical sense. It uses some anthropomorphic language (e.g. agents “know” or “decide”), but also warns that using such mentalistic terms for AI is just an abstraction and doesn’t mean the AI actually has a mind ￼. This is accurate and important to prevent readers from confusing simulation of agency with genuine human-like intent. However, the authors’ stance on AI intentionality may be a bit one-sided. They seem to imply that because AI doesn’t truly possess human-like will or understanding, it should be firmly kept as a tool. A counterpoint is that even without human-like consciousness, AI systems (especially those using reinforcement learning or advanced planning) can exhibit goal-directed behaviors that need to be taken seriously in design and oversight ￼. Dismissing the concept of AI agency too crudely might ignore progress in how AI can maintain goals, adapt, and “act” in the world, albeit in a programmed way. In summary, the technical discussion around what it means for an AI to be an autonomous agent could have been deeper – the paper raises the issue but doesn’t fully engage with the rich literature on agent theory and machine intentionality.

Ethical Reasoning and Balance of Argument
	•	Identification of Ethical Values: The paper admirably conducts a values-based analysis of AI agent autonomy. It examines how various moral and societal values (such as Safety, Privacy, Accuracy, Equity, etc.) are impacted as autonomy increases ￼ ￼. This structured approach ensures that the ethical critique isn’t abstract; it explicitly calls out, for example, that a fully autonomous system might threaten human safety (e.g. by taking dangerous actions), or undermine privacy (e.g. by acting on personal data without consent), or cause loss of human dignity and agency if decisions are fully ceded to machines. The breadth of values considered is a strength – it goes beyond just “safety” and “security” to include things like human-likeness and sustainability, showing a comprehensive ethical scope.
	•	Highlighting Realistic Concerns: Many of the concerns raised are grounded in realistic scenarios. For instance, the paper notes the risk of security breaches – an autonomous agent might find novel ways to bypass security measures or be repurposed by malicious actors (a “hijacking” scenario). It mentions job displacement, a genuine socio-economic impact of AI automation. It also raises the issue of misplaced trust: if users over-trust an autonomous agent, they might not double-check its decisions, leading to errors going unchecked ￼. These points resonate with current discussions in AI ethics and are well-taken. The authors are justifiably concerned that if AI agents act on our behalf without us in the loop, mistakes or biases in their behavior could directly translate into harm – from offensive content being posted automatically, to financial losses from bad trading decisions, to physical harm if robotics are involved. The ethical reasoning here is sound in identifying where things could go wrong and which human values are at stake.
	•	One-Sided Risk Emphasis: While the paper thoroughly catalogues risks, it offers relatively little about the potential benefits or moral justifications for autonomy. The stance is firmly precautionary: “fully autonomous AI agents should not be developed,” implying the safest route is to avoid this technology altogether ￼. What’s missing is a deep engagement with scenarios where increasing autonomy might be ethically desirable. For example, consider disaster response robots operating in radioactive or burning environments where sending a human is immoral due to danger – a fully autonomous agent might save lives in such cases. Or medical diagnostic agents that operate in remote regions with no doctors available – higher autonomy could bring expertise to underserved areas. The paper mentions benefits like efficiency and assistiveness, but these are often quickly dismissed or given much shorter treatment than the corresponding risks ￼. This imbalance can give the impression that the authors started with a conclusion (“autonomy is bad”) and only cherry-picked ethical considerations supporting that view, rather than doing a neutral weighing of pros and cons. A more balanced ethical argument would explicitly consider: Under what conditions (if any) would deploying a fully autonomous agent be morally justifiable or even obligatory? The paper’s title suggests none, but that absolutism isn’t really argued beyond stating the risks.
	•	Grounding in Realistic Scenarios: Some of the ethical fears seem grounded in rather speculative scenarios, which affects the argument’s practical relevance. For instance, the fear of an agent autonomously wreaking havoc (beyond what a human could stop) presumes a level of deployment and lack of oversight that responsible engineers are unlikely to allow in the near term. To the authors’ credit, they do discuss current products and marketing claims to show companies are moving toward more agentic systems, so the concern isn’t purely fictional. However, the most extreme harms (like an AI agent triggering a catastrophe) are not illustrated with equally extreme real-world examples – because none exist yet. This makes the ethical reasoning feel somewhat hypothetical. It’s important in ethics to use analogous cases or data (e.g. accidents in simpler automated systems) to argue what could happen as autonomy scales. The paper instead uses analogies like Asimov’s stories or Cold War incidents, which, while thought-provoking, might not convince a skeptic that AI agents pose similar imminent ethical dilemmas. In short, the moral concerns are valid, but their probability and context are not well established.
	•	No Middle Ground or Mitigation: Ethically, simply saying “don’t do it” skips over the harder question: If fully autonomous agents could bring significant benefits, how might we mitigate their risks to make their development ethical? The authors advocate avoiding full autonomy rather than managing it. This arguably sidesteps a key responsibility of ethicists: to guide how to do things responsibly when they do get done (since some actors may proceed regardless). There’s little discussion of governance, oversight mechanisms, or design principles (like ethical constraints or kill-switches) that could reduce the moral hazards of autonomy ￼. For a balanced ethical analysis, one would expect exploration of concepts like “safe autonomy”, “responsible innovation”, or conditional recommendations (e.g. only develop full agents for certain high-need domains under strict regulation). By not engaging with such nuances, the paper’s ethical stance comes off as paternalistic or alarmist, rather than pragmatic. It essentially favors a prohibition on a class of AI systems instead of considering a regulated or principled approach to their development. This absolutist ethic might be justified if one truly believes any fully autonomous agent is an unacceptable risk to human values – but the paper, in not exploring counterexamples, leaves that assertion unchallenged, which may not persuade all readers.

Coherence & Logical Consistency of the Argument
	•	Clarity of Thesis and Structure: The paper is well-structured and easy to follow. The authors state their thesis up front and maintain a clear through-line: at every point, they reinforce the idea that increasing autonomy leads to increasing harm, and thus we should stop short of full autonomy. The argument progresses logically: first defining terms and levels, then analyzing those levels across various value dimensions, and concluding with the recommendation against full autonomy. This structured approach (taxonomy → analysis → recommendation) is coherent and gives the paper an internal consistency. Each section builds on the last, and there are no obvious leaps or gaps in reasoning. For example, once the concept of agent levels is established, subsequent sections refer back to those levels when discussing, say, safety or privacy, which keeps the reader oriented. In terms of writing, the tone and stance are consistent throughout – the paper doesn’t contradict itself on key points. There isn’t a moment where they praise autonomy in one paragraph and vilify it in the next; the messaging is uniform and logically consistent with their premise ￼ ￼. This coherence is a strength, making the authors’ position easy to grasp.
	•	Logical Progression: The use of a values-based lens for each autonomy level gives the argument a methodical progression. It essentially performs a repeated risk-benefit analysis for Level 1, Level 2, … up to “Fully Autonomous” (Level 5) and finds that at low levels the benefits might outweigh risks, but as you approach Level 5, the risks multiply and start outweighing any benefits. This is a logically sound way to argue the thesis – by the time the reader sees the pattern of increasing risk with each step, the conclusion that “level 5 should be off-limits” feels like the natural culmination of the analysis. There’s a cause-and-effect reasoning presented: more autonomy → less human oversight → more things can go wrong → severe consequences justify prohibition. In general, the argument does follow from its premises: if one agrees with the assumptions (that technical safeguards won’t suffice, that human control is the only reliable safety net), then the conclusion is consistent with those assumptions.
	•	Potential Inconsistencies or Omissions: There are no direct contradictions in the paper’s claims, but there are some inconsistencies in emphasis that affect its persuasive power. One subtle issue is that the paper emphasizes human control as the solution (i.e. keep a human in the loop), but doesn’t address the reliability of that solution. It assumes humans will catch or prevent the harms that an AI agent might cause. However, we know from fields like automation and human-computer interaction that humans can become complacent or overwhelmed when overseeing autonomous systems (the “automation monitoring problem”). The authors don’t reconcile this known issue – if full autonomy is bad because humans aren’t watching, is partial autonomy always safe given that humans might be poor supervisors? This isn’t exactly a logical contradiction, but it is an oversight in the logic: the proposed remedy (always have human control) isn’t critiqued with the same rigor as the problem, which tilts the analysis. Another logical gap is the paper’s implicit assumption that forbidding a technology stops the risk. In reality, saying “don’t develop X” doesn’t guarantee X won’t be developed by someone (possibly in secret or in jurisdictions with different norms). The paper doesn’t grapple with this pragmatic consistency question – its recommendation is logically consistent internally (if X is too risky, don’t do X), but it may not be realistic or self-consistent in the broader context of AI progress. A truly consistent approach might have been “because X is risky, here’s how to control X’s development” to align with how technological bans often fail. The omission of this consideration could be seen as a minor logical blind spot.
	•	Tone and Rhetorical Consistency: The tone of the paper is cautionary, and sometimes veers into alarmist territory. Phrases like “some of the worst harms” or “snowball effect of yet further harms” are used to emphasize danger ￼ ￼. The consistent warning tone keeps the argument focused, but at times it undermines nuance. The logical progression might have been more persuasive if the tone were a bit more measured – currently, the reader might sense the authors are very certain of dire outcomes, which is consistent with their thesis but possibly inconsistently cautious compared to typical academic neutrality. However, this is more a stylistic critique than a breakdown in logic. The argument itself stays on track and does not contradict itself; it’s more that it contradicts some readers’ expectation of a balanced debate. In sum, the paper is coherent in its internal logic, but could be improved by acknowledging and logically integrating a few counterpoints (e.g. potential human oversight failure, or the feasibility of simply not developing a technology) to present a fully airtight case.

Representation of Existing Literature
	•	Citing Historical and Ethical Context: The authors do reference a mix of historical and contemporary works to situate their argument. They invoke classical thought like Aristotle and science-fiction ethics like Isaac Asimov’s laws of robotics ￼, demonstrating awareness that the question of controlling autonomous machines is not entirely new. Citing Aristotle (who imagined automated tools replacing the need for servants) and Asimov (who famously proposed built-in robot ethics) adds depth and shows the authors building on a longstanding discourse. The paper also cites modern AI ethics scholarship – for example, it references work like “Stochastic Parrots” (Bender et al., 2021) which is known for critiquing large language models and cautioning about their untruthfulness and potential harms ￼. By referencing such work, the authors align their argument with a body of literature skeptical of unconstrained AI. They also mention current industry reports and product documentation (the abstract notes “current product marketing” is used as a source ￼), meaning they looked at how companies are pitching “AI agents” and what capabilities are being claimed. This is valuable, as it uses real-world claims as evidence that fully autonomous agents are being considered (if not already attempted) by industry. Overall, the paper is not made in a vacuum; it builds upon existing discussions in AI ethics and tries to ground its stance in that context.
	•	Bias in Source Selection: Despite citing relevant literature, the paper appears to heavily favor sources that reinforce its cautionary stance, while omitting or downplaying opposing viewpoints. For instance, the inclusion of Bender et al. and other works by the authors themselves (Margaret Mitchell and collaborators have prior papers on AI ethics) suggests a somewhat insular selection of references. There is little mention of prominent literature from the pro-autonomy or AGI-research side. For example, nowhere does the paper directly engage with arguments from those who believe in developing advanced AI carefully (such as OpenAI or DeepMind’s publications on AI safety and alignment). Critics have pointed out that the authors “overlooked counterarguments from proponents of AGI or autonomous systems”, leading to a kind of confirmation bias in their citations ￼. By not citing or addressing such work, the paper misses the opportunity to rebut those viewpoints, which could have strengthened its argument. It would have been fair to acknowledge, say, the OpenAI “governance of superintelligence” proposal or other literature that contemplates managing the risks of powerful AI rather than prohibiting it. The absence of these references means the paper’s literature review doesn’t fully represent the state of debate; it represents mostly one side of it.
	•	Use of Prior Work in Argument: When the paper does cite existing literature, it generally does so accurately to support points (e.g., citing a Microsoft blog for single-step agents, or academic work on personality in AI ￼ ￼). However, some citations feel rather surface-level. The references to historical figures and laws (Aristotle, Asimov) serve more as illustrative quotes than substantive evidence. The paper might name-drop these to establish ethos, but it doesn’t deeply engage with the nuances of those works (for example, Asimov’s laws are mentioned, but then what? Are we to infer that Asimov’s approach wouldn’t work for AI agents? This isn’t made explicit). In terms of recent research, the paper does reference a 1995 agent overview by Wooldridge and Jennings ￼, which is great for showing that agent concepts predate the current fad – but again, it doesn’t contrast those classical autonomous agent architectures (often symbolic AI) with today’s LLM-based agents. A reader might wonder: are there lessons from the multi-agent systems community or robotics literature (which has wrestled with autonomy and safety for decades) that are applicable? The paper doesn’t cite much from robotics or control theory domains – literature that deals with autonomy (like on autonomous vehicles or robotic planning under uncertainty) could have provided empirical backbone or frameworks for risk mitigation. By mostly citing AI ethics and NLP-related works, the bibliography misses cross-disciplinary insights.
	•	Fairness and Completeness: In summary, the paper’s engagement with prior work is partially effective. It cites enough to show the authors are aware of key ethics discussions and historical perspectives, lending some credibility. Yet, it falls short of a balanced literature review. The selection of sources leans towards reinforcing the message that unchecked AI is dangerous (e.g., highlighting papers about AI failures, biases, or philosophical warnings). It does not fairly represent more optimistic or solution-oriented research. For a reader well-versed in AI literature, this one-sided citation practice might be noticeable. It could give an impression that the authors started with a conviction and curated references to support it, rather than neutrally surveying the full landscape of expert opinion. An improved approach would have been to cite and then critically discuss works from both sides – e.g., reference someone who advocates for developing autonomous AI (for instance, tech leaders or researchers who have argued that AGI could benefit humanity if properly aligned) and then explain why the authors still disagree. That would demonstrate a more comprehensive engagement with existing knowledge and strengthen the paper’s credibility as an objective analysis rather than a positioned essay.

Strengths, Weaknesses, and Areas for Improvement

In summary, the paper has several strengths: It tackles a timely topic – the ethics of AI agents – at a moment when such discussion is urgently needed. It presents a clear thesis and a logically coherent argument, using a structured framework (levels of autonomy and value categories) that makes the complex issue more understandable. The authors effectively highlight real risks of increasingly autonomous AI, such as safety failures, security exploits, and loss of human oversight, grounding these in both hypothetical examples and parallels to known problems in AI. The emphasis on a values-based evaluation is commendable, as it forces consideration of not just technical feasibility but what society stands to lose or gain with AI autonomy. These aspects make the paper a valuable starting point for debate, raising awareness of issues that might otherwise be overlooked in the excitement of new AI capabilities.

However, there are notable weaknesses that limit the paper’s impact. The stance of “do not develop fully autonomous agents” is unnuanced and absolute, leaving little room for discussion on conditional or domain-specific exceptions. This all-or-nothing approach could alienate practitioners and researchers who are exploring ways to build AI agents safely, and might even inadvertently hype the power of such agents (by implying they are so dangerous as to warrant a ban). The paper’s arguments would be stronger with more empirical backing – currently they rely on logical conjectures and analogies without real data from existing autonomous systems, which some readers may find speculative. The technical framing, while clear, is simplified; it doesn’t capture the complexity of partial autonomy and may misrepresent how current AI systems actually operate. Ethically, the paper leans heavily into worst-case risks and gives far less attention to the possible benefits of autonomy or the ethical imperative to innovate for social good (e.g. using autonomy in scenarios where humans can’t operate). This one-sided risk analysis could be improved by a more balanced cost-benefit discussion. Additionally, the paper offers little in terms of solutions aside from avoidance – it doesn’t explore how we might design autonomous agents with safeguards, or what governance could allow reaping benefits while containing risks. As a result, it stops short of providing guidance to those who might disagree but still want to act responsibly.

Areas for improvement include: (1) Softening the conclusion to allow for nuanced scenarios – for instance, saying fully autonomous agents should only be developed under certain strict conditions or not until specific safety guarantees are proven, rather than a blanket prohibition ￼. (2) Refining key definitions, especially what counts as “fully autonomous,” with more technical clarity (perhaps illustrating with current examples or bounding the capabilities expected at that level) ￼. (3) Bolstering the analysis with evidence – incorporating any available research on autonomous agent performance, failure rates, or even analogies from related fields like autonomous vehicles or software automation, to move beyond purely hypothetical reasoning ￼ ￼. (4) Considering counterarguments and mitigation: the paper should acknowledge the viewpoint that someone will pursue greater autonomy, and thus propose how to channel this development responsibly (via safety engineering, oversight frameworks, or ethical guidelines). Discussing regulatory or design safeguards (for example, sandboxing agents, implementing “off-switches” or ethical subroutines, tiered access to critical actions, etc.) would show a more constructive engagement with the problem ￼. (5) Engaging more diverse literature by citing and responding to works from the broader AI community, including those who may not share the authors’ pessimism, to avoid any perception of bias and to strengthen the credibility of the analysis through open dialogue.

Overall, “Fully Autonomous AI Agents Should Not be Developed” succeeds in raising an alarm bell about the unchecked rush toward highly autonomous AI. Its arguments are coherent and grounded in legitimate ethical principles, but to convince a skeptical, technical audience, it could benefit from a more balanced and evidence-rich approach. By incorporating some of the improvements above, future work on this topic can provide a more robust guide for AI development – one that not only cautions against dangers but also charts a path toward safe and beneficial use of AI autonomy. The paper as it stands is a strong cautionary note, and with further refinement, it can evolve into a well-rounded piece that informs both the risks and the remedies in the quest for responsible AI agents.
