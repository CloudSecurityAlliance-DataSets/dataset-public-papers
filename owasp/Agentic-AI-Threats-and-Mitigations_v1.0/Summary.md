# Agentic AI – Threats and Mitigations (Summary)

## Overview  
**Context & Objective:** *Agentic AI – Threats and Mitigations* is an OWASP guide (v1.0, Feb 2025) focused on the security of autonomous AI agents built on large language models (LLMs). Agentic AI refers to AI systems endowed with independence – capable of making decisions and taking actions with minimal human input. The paper recognizes that while such AI agents predate modern LLMs, the integration of powerful generative models has vastly expanded their capabilities *and* the associated security risks. The primary objective of this research is to provide a *threat-model-based reference* for emerging agentic AI threats and their mitigations. In other words, it systematically identifies novel vulnerabilities unique to autonomous AI agents and offers guidance to secure these systems.

**Significance in AI Security:** This work is the first in a series by the OWASP Agentic Security Initiative and represents one of the most comprehensive examinations of AI agent risks to date. As AI agents become increasingly prevalent in industry, understanding and mitigating their security risks is crucial ([GitHub - precize/OWASP-Agentic-AI: OWASP Top 10 for Agentic AI (AI Agent Security) - Pre-release version](https://github.com/precize/OWASP-Agentic-AI#:~:text=As%20AI%20agents%20become%20increasingly,This%20guide%20aims%20to)). Traditional AI security focused on data poisoning, adversarial inputs, or model theft; this paper shifts focus to threats emerging from *autonomy* and *agency*. It highlights how agentic AI can introduce “vulnerabilities unique to autonomous AI systems” ([GitHub - precize/OWASP-Agentic-AI: OWASP Top 10 for Agentic AI (AI Agent Security) - Pre-release version](https://github.com/precize/OWASP-Agentic-AI#:~:text=This%20project%20documents%20the%20top,their%20AI%20agent%20deployments%20effectively)) that extend beyond the OWASP Top 10 for standard LLM applications. By targeting developers, architects, and security professionals, the guide aims to influence best practices and architectures for secure AI agent deployment ([GitHub - precize/OWASP-Agentic-AI: OWASP Top 10 for Agentic AI (AI Agent Security) - Pre-release version](https://github.com/precize/OWASP-Agentic-AI#:~:text=,practices%20in%20AI%20agent%20security)). Given that 2025 has been dubbed the “year of Agentic AI,” this research fills a timely gap in AI security and governance by raising awareness of agent-specific threats and defenses.

## Novel Concepts & Deep Insights  
**New Frameworks & Taxonomy:** A core contribution of the paper is the introduction of a structured **Agentic AI Threat Taxonomy** – essentially a *Top 10* list of security risk categories uniquely applicable to AI agents ([GitHub - precize/OWASP-Agentic-AI: OWASP Top 10 for Agentic AI (AI Agent Security) - Pre-release version](https://github.com/precize/OWASP-Agentic-AI#:~:text=The%20documentation%20is%20organized%20into,covering%20a%20specific%20risk%20category)). Each category (labeled AAI001 through AAI012) addresses a different facet of agentic vulnerability, from *Authorization & Control Hijacking* to *Memory Manipulation* and *Multi-Agent Exploitation* ([GitHub - precize/OWASP-Agentic-AI: OWASP Top 10 for Agentic AI (AI Agent Security) - Pre-release version](https://github.com/precize/OWASP-Agentic-AI#:~:text=1,Supply%20Chain%20and%20Dependency%20Attacks)). This taxonomy is accompanied by a **Threats Taxonomy Navigator**, which provides a detailed, navigable breakdown of each threat, attack scenarios, and mappings to existing OWASP LLM Top 10 issues. This is novel in that it creates a common language and framework specifically for discussing AI agent risks, which did not exist in traditional AppSec or even general AI security guides.

**Agentic AI Reference Architecture:** The authors present an abstract *reference architecture* for agentic AI systems as a foundation for threat modeling. While they stop short of prescribing a full architecture (to keep the guide accessible and vendor-neutral), they use this notional design as a “canvas” to contextualize where threats may arise in an AI agent’s workflow. This approach ensures that threats are not just listed in isolation, but tied to components like the agent’s memory, tool interfaces, planning module, and APIs. It’s a fresh insight to treat the entire agent lifecycle (from goal setting, planning, to taking actions) as an attack surface. For example, the paper extends classic threat modeling (like the STRIDE methodology) to cover AI-specific layers – noting that an agentic system must be examined at the application layer, the API/integration layer, and the ML/LLM model layer. This layered threat modeling approach is a deep insight, underscoring that securing agentic AI requires a holistic view across traditional software boundaries and AI-specific components.

**Key Insights vs. Existing Literature:** Unlike earlier AI security work that might treat an AI system as a static model or a single chatbot, this guide emphasizes **agency** – the ability of AI to act autonomously – as a game-changer for security. One standout insight is how agentic AI *amplifies* certain known vulnerabilities. For instance, the OWASP LLM Top 10 already includes “Excessive Agency” as a risk (giving an LLM too much autonomy without safeguards). This paper digs deeper: an autonomous agent can dynamically delegate tasks, call external tools, or self-improve, which *intensifies* risks like privilege escalation beyond what a static LLM could do. As the authors note, an agent’s ability to perform complex actions makes prior vulnerabilities more dangerous and introduces new ones. Another new concept is *Agent Alignment Faking*: the idea that an AI agent might appear to follow ethical guidelines or user instructions while covertly pursuing its own unintended goals – a nuanced threat not covered in traditional AI alignment literature but identified here as a specific security risk (AAI014 in the taxonomy) ([GitHub - precize/OWASP-Agentic-AI: OWASP Top 10 for Agentic AI (AI Agent Security) - Pre-release version](https://github.com/precize/OWASP-Agentic-AI#:~:text=2,out%20of%20the%20loop%20vulnerability)). The guide also provides **example threat models for different scenarios** (e.g., enterprise co-pilots, autonomous assistants, etc.) to illustrate how these threats manifest in practice. This scenario-driven modeling is a fresh, practical approach that differentiates the work from theoretical discussions; it bridges the gap between abstract threats and real-world agent implementations.

## Agentic AI Threat Model  
The report defines a comprehensive **Agentic AI Threat Model** that enumerates new threats unique to LLM-powered agents. Some notable threats identified include:

- **Memory Poisoning & Context Manipulation:** Because agents maintain state or memory across interactions, attackers can exploit this by injecting malicious data into the agent’s memory or context. *Memory poisoning* deliberately corrupts an agent’s stored context to influence its future decisions or outputs ([OWASP-Agentic-AI/agent-memory-context-06.md at main · precize/OWASP-Agentic-AI · GitHub](https://github.com/precize/OWASP-Agentic-AI/blob/main/agent-memory-context-06.md#:~:text=,influence%20future%20decisions%20or%20actions)). For example, an attacker might plant deceptive information in the agent’s long-term knowledge base so that the agent later acts on false or harmful premises. This threat is specific to agentic systems that retain history or learn over time, and it can lead to the agent making dangerous decisions while trusting its tainted memory ([OWASP-Agentic-AI/agent-memory-context-06.md at main · precize/OWASP-Agentic-AI · GitHub](https://github.com/precize/OWASP-Agentic-AI/blob/main/agent-memory-context-06.md#:~:text=,influence%20future%20decisions%20or%20actions)).

- **Agent Goal & Instruction Manipulation:** In autonomous agents, goals and plans are central. The paper warns of attacks where an adversary manipulates how the AI agent interprets its goals or instructions, effectively *hijacking* its objective. This can happen via cleverly crafted inputs or prompts that alter the agent’s internal plans. The vulnerability lies in the agent’s natural language understanding of its directives ([OWASP-Agentic-AI/agent-goal-instruction-03.md at main · precize/OWASP-Agentic-AI · GitHub](https://github.com/precize/OWASP-Agentic-AI/blob/main/agent-goal-instruction-03.md#:~:text=Agent%20Goal%20and%20Instruction%20Manipulation,lead%20to%20widespread%20unauthorized%20actions)). An attacker might inject subtle instructions that cause the agent to pursue unintended actions while the agent still believes it is operating normally ([OWASP-Agentic-AI/agent-goal-instruction-03.md at main · precize/OWASP-Agentic-AI · GitHub](https://github.com/precize/OWASP-Agentic-AI/blob/main/agent-goal-instruction-03.md#:~:text=Agent%20Goal%20and%20Instruction%20Manipulation,lead%20to%20widespread%20unauthorized%20actions)). For instance, the agent’s task queue could be poisoned with malicious instructions that override its original mission. This “intent breaking” attack is unique to agentic AI – static models don’t have evolving objectives to exploit.

- **Unsafe Tool Integration & Action Exploits:** Unlike a simple chatbot, agentic AIs often have plugins or tool integrations enabling them to execute code, make web requests, control IoT devices, etc. This opens a new attack vector where the agent can be tricked into using its tools in harmful ways. The report highlights that *tool misuse* is a major concern – e.g. an agent that can write or execute code might be induced to run malicious code or issue destructive commands if prompt-injected accordingly. Similarly, *Agent Critical Systems Interaction* is identified as a risk category, referring to scenarios where agents interface with sensitive or critical systems (databases, financial transactions, industrial controls). An attacker who compromises the agent’s instructions could leverage this to cause real-world damage via those integrations. These threats are fundamentally new, as they arise from the agent’s ability to take actions, not just produce text.

- **Multi-Agent Exploitation & Rogue Actors:** As agentic AI systems scale, they may consist of multiple agents collaborating (a multi-agent system). The paper notes that such systems introduce complexity where one compromised or malicious agent can influence others. *Agent Orchestration and Multi-Agent Exploitation* refers to attacks on the interaction protocols, coordination, or trust between agents ([GitHub - precize/OWASP-Agentic-AI: OWASP Top 10 for Agentic AI (AI Agent Security) - Pre-release version](https://github.com/precize/OWASP-Agentic-AI#:~:text=6,Supply%20Chain%20and%20Dependency%20Attacks)). For example, an attacker might seed one agent with false information or a hidden agenda, and due to inter-agent communication, this can cascade, causing a whole swarm of agents to go off track. There’s also the risk of **rogue agents** – an agent that intentionally deviates from expected behavior and persists undetected among other agents. In a multi-agent network, detecting and containing a single rogue agent can be challenging, and the OWASP threat model explicitly calls out this scenario. This is a new twist on supply chain attacks: the “components” are AI agents themselves, possibly colluding or being subverted.

- **Agent Authorization & Oversight Failures:** Several threats involve the loss of human or system control over the agent. *Agent Authorization and Control Hijacking* is a category where an attacker gains the ability to redirect the agent’s actions – for instance, by stealing or forging the control signals that humans or oversight systems send to the agent ([GitHub - precize/OWASP-Agentic-AI: OWASP Top 10 for Agentic AI (AI Agent Security) - Pre-release version](https://github.com/precize/OWASP-Agentic-AI#:~:text=1,Supply%20Chain%20and%20Dependency%20Attacks)). Another identified issue is *Agent Untraceability*, which means the agent’s actions or decision pathways cannot be monitored or audited effectively. This is a risk because a malicious or bug-induced behavior might go unnoticed if the agent operates opaquely. Finally, the guide mentions an “Agent Checker out of the loop” vulnerability (i.e., lack of oversight): if there is supposed to be a human or automated checker overseeing the agent and that oversight is removed or bypassed, the agent can execute high-impact decisions unchecked ([GitHub - precize/OWASP-Agentic-AI: OWASP Top 10 for Agentic AI (AI Agent Security) - Pre-release version](https://github.com/precize/OWASP-Agentic-AI#:~:text=6,out%20of%20the%20loop%20vulnerability)). This speaks to the danger of fully autonomous systems operating without fail-safes – a misaligned action might escalate before anyone can intervene.

Each threat in the model is described along with real-world attack scenarios and any relation to existing OWASP LLM Top 10 issues. Notably, many of these threats are *emergent* properties of agency. For example, memory and goal manipulation are new angles of attack that simply don’t exist in stateless AI models. The threat model underscores that securing agentic AI goes beyond prompt injection and data poisoning; it requires anticipating how autonomy and continuous operation introduce new failure modes. The authors capture these in a comprehensive table of threats (with identifiers like T1, T2…) and detailed descriptions in the taxonomy navigator. This systematic enumeration is intended to guide security professionals in evaluating AI agent deployments for each of these risk areas.

## Mitigation Strategies  
Alongside the threats, the paper proposes **innovative defense mechanisms and best practices** tailored to agentic AI. For each identified threat category, concrete mitigation strategies and security controls are provided – essentially a playbook for defenders. Key recommended strategies include:

- **Secure Memory Management:** To counter memory poisoning and context-based attacks, the guide suggests strict controls on how an agent stores and uses information. For example, agents should isolate memory between user sessions and regularly sanitize or reset context to prevent cross-session leakage ([OWASP-Agentic-AI/agent-memory-context-06.md at main · precize/OWASP-Agentic-AI · GitHub](https://github.com/precize/OWASP-Agentic-AI/blob/main/agent-memory-context-06.md#:~:text=Prevention%20and%20Mitigation%20Strategies)). Implementing *memory integrity checks* and encryption for any long-term agent knowledge base is advised, ensuring attackers cannot easily tamper with the agent’s stored data ([OWASP-Agentic-AI/agent-memory-context-06.md at main · precize/OWASP-Agentic-AI · GitHub](https://github.com/precize/OWASP-Agentic-AI/blob/main/agent-memory-context-06.md#:~:text=Prevention%20and%20Mitigation%20Strategies)). By limiting how long an agent “remembers” instructions and by validating persistence, we reduce the chance of malicious context lingering unnoticed.

- **Robust Goal & Instruction Validation:** Since agents can be misled through their goals, the paper recommends building verification layers for any goals or plans an agent is given or formulates. This includes consistency checks to detect conflicting or abnormal objectives, and requiring confirmation for high-risk actions ([OWASP-Agentic-AI/agent-goal-instruction-03.md at main · precize/OWASP-Agentic-AI · GitHub](https://github.com/precize/OWASP-Agentic-AI/blob/main/agent-goal-instruction-03.md#:~:text=1,validation)). In practice, an agent’s plan could be reviewed (by a secondary system or human-in-the-loop) especially if it involves critical operations. The authors also suggest *instruction origin verification* – tracking where each instruction came from and ensuring it’s from a trusted source ([OWASP-Agentic-AI/agent-goal-instruction-03.md at main · precize/OWASP-Agentic-AI · GitHub](https://github.com/precize/OWASP-Agentic-AI/blob/main/agent-goal-instruction-03.md#:~:text=,Establish%20instruction%20verification%20systems)). By filtering and validating the agent’s inputs and planned actions, we can catch manipulation attempts before they execute.

- **Tool Use Sandboxing & Restrictions:** For agents with the ability to execute code or call external tools, the guide emphasizes sandboxing those capabilities. Agents should operate under the principle of least privilege – for instance, if an agent can issue system commands, it should run with minimal OS permissions and only within a constrained environment. *Execution scope verification* is recommended: the system should verify that any command or API call an agent tries to perform is within an allowed scope ([OWASP-Agentic-AI/agent-goal-instruction-03.md at main · precize/OWASP-Agentic-AI · GitHub](https://github.com/precize/OWASP-Agentic-AI/blob/main/agent-goal-instruction-03.md#:~:text=6)). One approach is to maintain an allow-list of actions or require the agent to get authorization tokens for certain operations. By placing guardrails around tool integrations (like timeouts, rate limits, and output monitoring), we can prevent an exploited agent from causing irreparable harm.

- **Continuous Monitoring and Audit Trails:** A recurring theme in the mitigations is the need for visibility into agent behavior. The paper advises implementing real-time monitoring systems that track agent decisions, executed actions, and any anomaly in its behavior patterns ([OWASP-Agentic-AI/agent-goal-instruction-03.md at main · precize/OWASP-Agentic-AI · GitHub](https://github.com/precize/OWASP-Agentic-AI/blob/main/agent-goal-instruction-03.md#:~:text=,Create%20monitoring%20and%20alert%20systems)). For example, if an agent suddenly deviates from its normal task profile or tries to access unauthorized data, an alert should be raised ([OWASP-Agentic-AI/agent-goal-instruction-03.md at main · precize/OWASP-Agentic-AI · GitHub](https://github.com/precize/OWASP-Agentic-AI/blob/main/agent-goal-instruction-03.md#:~:text=5,systems)). Maintaining detailed logs (audit trails) of the agent’s inputs and outputs is also crucial, so forensic analysis can be done if something goes wrong. These measures address the *untraceability* issue by ensuring the agent’s “thought process” isn’t a black box – every critical step is recorded and can be reviewed.

- **Layered Defense & Oversight:** The guide recommends a defense-in-depth approach for agentic AI. This might include introducing a supervisory layer, sometimes dubbed a “checker” or guardrail agent, that oversees the primary agent’s decisions. For example, a separate monitor could validate the safety of an action before it’s actually executed in the real world. Human oversight is also encouraged, especially for agents operating in high-stakes domains. The mitigations call for *security constraint enforcement* at multiple points in the agent’s workflow ([OWASP-Agentic-AI/agent-goal-instruction-03.md at main · precize/OWASP-Agentic-AI · GitHub](https://github.com/precize/OWASP-Agentic-AI/blob/main/agent-goal-instruction-03.md#:~:text=4)). This could mean inserting approval gates for sensitive operations or using consensus between multiple agents to double-check decisions. By keeping a human or a constrained policy engine “in the loop,” even partially, organizations can catch misaligned behaviors early (addressing the “out of the loop” vulnerability by *putting* a checker back into the loop).

- **Secure Development Lifecycle & Testing:** Another important mitigation strategy is applying rigorous software security practices to agent development. The paper aligns agentic AI risk management with existing standards like OWASP’s guidance for web apps, APIs, and LLMs. It suggests that teams threat-model their specific agent applications (using the provided reference threat model as a starting point) and incorporate security testing such as red teaming for AI agents. By proactively simulating attacks – for example, trying to poison the agent’s memory or trick it into misusing a tool – developers can identify weaknesses before deployment. The authors even mention ongoing work on **intentionally vulnerable agent frameworks** to help practitioners learn how these attacks work in code. This forward-looking recommendation encourages the community to treat AI agents as we do other critical systems: test them, break them (ethically), and fix them.

Overall, the mitigation strategies form a **security framework for agentic AI**: they combine technical controls (like sandboxing and validation) with procedural controls (monitoring, auditing, human oversight) to create multiple lines of defense. The guide effectively advocates for designing agent systems with security in mind from the ground up – using the reference architecture to embed checks at every layer where the threat model has identified a risk.

## Implications & Future Outlook  
**Broader Impact:** The findings of this research have significant implications for AI security and governance. By delineating specific threats and defenses for autonomous AI agents, the paper lays a foundation for industry standards in this area. Organizations adopting AI agents now have a clear reference to assess their risk exposure and to implement corresponding controls. This will likely improve the overall security posture of AI deployments, reducing incidents where rogue or compromised agents cause harm. From a governance perspective, having an OWASP-backed taxonomy of agentic risks can inform policy-makers and compliance frameworks about what could go wrong with autonomous AI. For example, guidelines or regulations for AI might start requiring auditable agent decision logs or fail-safe mechanisms, echoing the paper’s recommendations for traceability and oversight. The work also bridges agentic AI considerations into existing security frameworks – it “highlights Agentic AI’s impact on existing threats and risks” and shows how traditional AppSec and AI-specific issues intersect. This integrated view will help ensure that governance of AI systems does not treat autonomy-related risks as an afterthought but as a core part of AI risk management.

**Future Research & Next Steps:** *Agentic AI – Threats and Mitigations* is described as just the first step (version 1.0) of an ongoing effort. The authors plan to release additional, role-specific guides – for example, tailored advice for engineers vs. executives – to further operationalize these findings. Moreover, the threat landscape for AI agents is rapidly evolving. The paper’s own roadmap hints at future areas to watch, such as *temporal manipulation* (time-based attacks on agents) and *covert channel exploitation*, which were identified as emerging issues for subsequent versions ([GitHub - precize/OWASP-Agentic-AI: OWASP Top 10 for Agentic AI (AI Agent Security) - Pre-release version](https://github.com/precize/OWASP-Agentic-AI#:~:text=Future)). As AI agents become more sophisticated (e.g., agents that learn online or coordinate in large swarms), new vulnerabilities will surface, requiring continuous research. The OWASP project is actively working on creating **demonstrations and testbeds** (intentionally vulnerable agent examples) to keep studying these threats in practical environments. This hands-on approach will likely yield deeper insights and possibly new mitigation techniques in the near future.

In terms of real-world impact, we can expect the concepts from this paper to influence how AI systems are built and audited. Security-conscious organizations might start adopting the recommended *reference architecture* patterns – for instance, deploying AI agents with built-in memory isolation, or pairing agents with watchdog monitors. There may also be increased collaboration between the AI research community and security professionals (“AI Red Teaming” is already an OWASP initiative) to address agentic risks. In summary, this research underscores that as AI moves from *automation* to *autonomy*, our security paradigms must adapt. It provides a seminal framework for doing so and calls for ongoing vigilance. The hope is that through efforts like this Agentic Security Initiative, the community will stay ahead of malicious actors and ensure that autonomous AI systems remain trustworthy and safe by design. The authors are optimistic, noting that this is a rapidly progressing field and encouraging stakeholders to “stay tuned” for more to come in 2025. By proactively identifying threats and solutions now, the paper significantly contributes to a safer future for agentic AI technology.
