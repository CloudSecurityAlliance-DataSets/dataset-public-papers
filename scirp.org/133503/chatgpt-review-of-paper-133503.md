# Summary of *"Security Vulnerability Analyses of Large Language Models (LLMs) through Extension of the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) Framework"*

## Overview:
Large Language Models (LLMs) have rapidly become integral to many applications (e.g. text generation, translation, summarization), but their widespread use raises critical security and safety concerns ([Security Vulnerability Analyses of Large Language Models (LLMs) through Extension of the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) Framework](https://www.scirp.org/pdf/jsea2024175_99303262.pdf#:~:text=Large%20Language%20Models%20,and%20reliability%20of%20their%20outputs)). The paper by Biju *et al.* addresses two prominent vulnerabilities in LLMs – **prompt injection** (maliciously manipulating an AI’s prompts/instructions) and **training data poisoning** (corrupting a model’s training data) – which can lead to unpredictable or harmful behaviors such as biased outputs, misinformation, or malicious content generation ([Security Vulnerability Analyses of Large Language Models (LLMs) through Extension of the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) Framework](https://www.scirp.org/pdf/jsea2024175_99303262.pdf#:~:text=and%20minimize%20harmful%20effects,CVSS%29%20framework%20provides%20a)). The authors’ primary objective is to improve the way we assess and prioritize such AI-specific vulnerabilities by extending the well-known **Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)**. CVSS is a standardized framework widely used in cybersecurity to characterize and score the severity of software vulnerabilities ([Security Vulnerability Analyses of Large Language Models (LLMs) through Extension of the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) Framework](https://www.scirp.org/pdf/jsea2024175_99303262.pdf#:~:text=The%20Common%20Vulnerability%20Scoring%20System,vulnerabilities%20such%20that%20organizations%20can)). By adapting this framework to LLMs, the study aims to provide a systematic scoring method for LLM vulnerabilities so that organizations can gauge their severity, prioritize mitigation efforts, allocate resources effectively, and implement targeted defenses ([Security Vulnerability Analyses of Large Language Models (LLMs) through Extension of the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) Framework](https://www.scirp.org/pdf/jsea2024175_99303262.pdf#:~:text=The%20Common%20Vulnerability%20Scoring%20System,to%20defend%20against%20potential%20risks)). This work is significant in the AI security field because it bridges a gap between traditional cybersecurity practices and emerging AI risks – allowing security and AI communities to share a common language for understanding LLM vulnerabilities’ severity ([Security Vulnerability Analyses of Large Language Models (LLMs) through Extension of the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) Framework](https://www.scirp.org/pdf/jsea2024175_99303262.pdf#:~:text=The%20Common%20Vulnerability%20Scoring%20System,vulnerabilities%20such%20that%20organizations%20can)). In essence, the paper’s context underscores the growing need for **robust AI security measures** as LLMs become ubiquitous, and its contribution lies in proposing a **framework to quantify and communicate the risk** of LLM-specific attacks in a standardized way.

## Novel Concepts & Deep Insights:
The most novel contribution of this research is the **extension of the CVSS framework** with new metrics tailored to the unique characteristics of LLM vulnerabilities ([Security Vulnerability Analyses of Large Language Models (LLMs) through Extension of the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) Framework](https://www.scirp.org/pdf/jsea2024175_99303262.pdf#:~:text=assess%20and%20mitigate%20vulnerabilities%20specific,Its%20description%20is%20%E2%80%9CThis)). The authors introduce several new concepts within CVSS’s exploitability and impact assessment categories to capture factors that traditional CVSS scoring would miss for AI models. Notably, they propose three new *exploitability* metrics and two new *impact* metrics: 

- **Attack Origin (AO):** This metric denotes where an attack originates – whether from an internal source (insider or within the organization’s network) or an external source (outside actor), or a combination/unknown source ([Security Vulnerability Analyses of Large Language Models (LLMs) through Extension of the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) Framework](https://www.scirp.org/pdf/jsea2024175_99303262.pdf#:~:text=The%20first%20metric%20we%20propose,is%20presented%20in%20%E2%80%9CTable%201%E2%80%9D)) ([Security Vulnerability Analyses of Large Language Models (LLMs) through Extension of the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) Framework](https://www.scirp.org/pdf/jsea2024175_99303262.pdf#:~:text=Internal%20,facing%20assets%20%28eg%3A%20websites%2C%20servers)). For example, an internal-origin attack might involve an insider with privileged access, whereas an external-origin attack comes from outside the organization ([Security Vulnerability Analyses of Large Language Models (LLMs) through Extension of the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) Framework](https://www.scirp.org/pdf/jsea2024175_99303262.pdf#:~:text=Internal%20,external%20threat%20actors%20targeting%20the)). This distinction is important because it helps organizations understand if a threat is an insider issue or an external attack, influencing how they allocate security resources ([Security Vulnerability Analyses of Large Language Models (LLMs) through Extension of the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) Framework](https://www.scirp.org/pdf/jsea2024175_99303262.pdf#:~:text=metric%20evaluates%20the%20origin%20or,The%20list%20of%20possible%20values)).

- **Access Complexity (AC):** This metric (not to be confused with the similarly named term in older CVSS versions) represents the level of access **and knowledge** an attacker needs to exploit the LLM vulnerability ([Security Vulnerability Analyses of Large Language Models (LLMs) through Extension of the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) Framework](https://www.scirp.org/pdf/jsea2024175_99303262.pdf#:~:text=is%20presented%20in%20%E2%80%9CTable%201%E2%80%9D,Its%20description%20is)). It accounts for whether an attack can be conducted in a *“black-box”* manner (little to no knowledge of the model’s internals) or requires *“white-box”* access (deep knowledge or insider access), or something in between ([Security Vulnerability Analyses of Large Language Models (LLMs) through Extension of the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) Framework](https://www.scirp.org/pdf/jsea2024175_99303262.pdf#:~:text=Table%202,BT)) ([Security Vulnerability Analyses of Large Language Models (LLMs) through Extension of the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) Framework](https://www.scirp.org/pdf/jsea2024175_99303262.pdf#:~:text=analysis%20and%20precise%20exploitation%20of,is%20presented%20in%20%E2%80%9CTable%203%E2%80%9D)). In essence, AC captures how complex it is for an adversary to set up and execute the attack, including any specialized knowledge of the model or system needed to succeed ([Security Vulnerability Analyses of Large Language Models (LLMs) through Extension of the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) Framework](https://www.scirp.org/pdf/jsea2024175_99303262.pdf#:~:text=is%20presented%20in%20%E2%80%9CTable%201%E2%80%9D,is%20presented%20in%20%E2%80%9CTable%202%E2%80%9D)). This helps in understanding the **difficulty of carrying out the attack**, which is crucial for risk assessment and planning defenses.

- **Attacker Interaction (AI):** This new metric gauges the degree of ongoing interaction or involvement required from the attacker to successfully exploit the model ([Security Vulnerability Analyses of Large Language Models (LLMs) through Extension of the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) Framework](https://www.scirp.org/pdf/jsea2024175_99303262.pdf#:~:text=The%20third%20metric%20we%20propose,manipulate%20the%20target%20system%20effectively)). It reflects how *“hands-on”* the attack must be. For instance, some attacks might require **no further interaction** after the initial exploit (the paper labels this as “None” – meaning the attack can propagate or cause damage without ongoing attacker input) ([Security Vulnerability Analyses of Large Language Models (LLMs) through Extension of the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) Framework](https://www.scirp.org/pdf/jsea2024175_99303262.pdf#:~:text=Table%203,executed%20without%20any%20direct%20interaction)). Other attacks might require **low interaction** (perhaps just a single prompt injection) versus **high interaction** (multiple iterative steps, continuous adjustments, or prolonged engagement with the model) ([Security Vulnerability Analyses of Large Language Models (LLMs) through Extension of the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) Framework](https://www.scirp.org/pdf/jsea2024175_99303262.pdf#:~:text=4,They%20are%20challenging%20to)). This concept is akin to assessing the attack’s *sophistication* – attacks requiring high attacker involvement may be more complex or targeted ([Security Vulnerability Analyses of Large Language Models (LLMs) through Extension of the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) Framework](https://www.scirp.org/pdf/jsea2024175_99303262.pdf#:~:text=4,They%20are%20challenging%20to)), whereas “fire-and-forget” exploits (no interaction) could spread rapidly and broadly ([Security Vulnerability Analyses of Large Language Models (LLMs) through Extension of the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) Framework](https://www.scirp.org/pdf/jsea2024175_99303262.pdf#:~:text=4,They%20are%20challenging%20to)). Introducing the AI metric is novel because it captures how self-sustaining or labor-intensive an LLM attack is, which wasn’t explicitly measured in standard CVSS.

- **Internal Organizational Impact (IOI):** To gauge the consequences of an LLM vulnerability *within* an organization, the authors add this impact metric ([Security Vulnerability Analyses of Large Language Models (LLMs) through Extension of the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) Framework](https://www.scirp.org/pdf/jsea2024175_99303262.pdf#:~:text=The%20first%20metric%20we%20propose,sensitive%20information%2C%20and%20reputational%20damage)). It considers how an exploit affects internal operations, such as losses in employee productivity or morale, disruption to business continuity, compromise of intellectual property, or damage to the organization’s reputation among employees and partners ([Security Vulnerability Analyses of Large Language Models (LLMs) through Extension of the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) Framework](https://www.scirp.org/pdf/jsea2024175_99303262.pdf#:~:text=The%20first%20metric%20we%20propose,sensitive%20information%2C%20and%20reputational%20damage)). This extends beyond the classic confidentiality/integrity/availability impacts by explicitly measuring internal business harm – a critical insight since an AI system’s malfunction could erode trust or efficiency inside the organization even if no external breach occurs.

- **External Organizational Impact (EOI):** Complementing the internal impact, this metric assesses harm to the organization’s external standing ([Security Vulnerability Analyses of Large Language Models (LLMs) through Extension of the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) Framework](https://www.scirp.org/pdf/jsea2024175_99303262.pdf#:~:text=The%20second%20metric%20we%20propose,%E2%80%9D%20The%20list%20of)). It covers loss of customer trust or loyalty, financial losses (e.g. revenue impact, ransom payments, remediation costs), disruptions to customer service or supply chains, reputational damage in the public eye, and regulatory or legal scrutiny resulting from the AI system’s compromise ([Security Vulnerability Analyses of Large Language Models (LLMs) through Extension of the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) Framework](https://www.scirp.org/pdf/jsea2024175_99303262.pdf#:~:text=The%20second%20metric%20we%20propose,%E2%80%9D%20The%20list%20of)). This is particularly insightful for LLMs, because failures like producing misinformation or offensive content can quickly become public incidents that damage a company’s brand and invite regulatory attention. By defining EOI, the framework acknowledges that LLM security issues can have **broad external ramifications**, which is a novel consideration not explicitly accounted for in traditional CVSS.

These new metrics collectively represent an **innovative framework** for LLM vulnerability analysis. The authors didn’t simply propose them in isolation; they also **revised the CVSS scoring formula** to incorporate these factors. For example, the standard CVSS *exploitability sub-score* equation is modified to include **Attack Origin, Access Complexity,** and **Attacker Interaction** alongside traditional factors like attack vector, complexity, privileges, and user interaction ([Security Vulnerability Analyses of Large Language Models (LLMs) through Extension of the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) Framework](https://www.scirp.org/pdf/jsea2024175_99303262.pdf#:~:text=8,Org%201%20Impact%20External%20Org)). Likewise, the *impact sub-score* formula is extended to include **Internal** and **External Organizational Impact** in addition to the usual confidentiality, integrity, and availability impact metrics ([Security Vulnerability Analyses of Large Language Models (LLMs) through Extension of the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) Framework](https://www.scirp.org/pdf/jsea2024175_99303262.pdf#:~:text=,2)). This extension of CVSS is a core theoretical contribution – it adapts a well-established cybersecurity framework to the AI domain, ensuring that the unique nuances of LLM threats (like insider vs outsider attacks, attacker effort, and reputational damage) are quantitatively reflected in vulnerability scoring. A deep insight here is that **AI system vulnerabilities require a more holistic scoring approach**: beyond just technical exploitability, one must consider how attacks on AI can affect human trust and organizational well-being. By enriching CVSS in this way, the paper provides a more nuanced lens to view AI security issues ([Security Vulnerability Analyses of Large Language Models (LLMs) through Extension of the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) Framework](https://www.scirp.org/pdf/jsea2024175_99303262.pdf#:~:text=assess%20and%20mitigate%20vulnerabilities%20specific,Its%20description%20is%20%E2%80%9CThis)), which is a clear break from earlier literature that either qualitatively discussed LLM risks or did not integrate them into existing security scoring systems.

Another noteworthy insight from the study comes from its examination of actual attack scenarios on generative models. The authors conducted a **threat analysis of known LLM attacks** (particularly focusing on DALL-E, a text-to-image generative model) to inform their framework ([Security Vulnerability Analyses of Large Language Models (LLMs) through Extension of the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) Framework](https://www.scirp.org/pdf/jsea2024175_99303262.pdf#:~:text=4,E)). Through this analysis, they identified patterns such as adversaries manipulating prompts in subtle ways – for instance, inserting gibberish, homoglyphs (look-alike characters), adding extra spaces, or paraphrasing prompts – to exploit the model ([Security Vulnerability Analyses of Large Language Models (LLMs) through Extension of the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) Framework](https://www.scirp.org/pdf/jsea2024175_99303262.pdf#:~:text=The%20exploration%20of%20attacks%20targeting,Various%20attack%20techniques)). Such techniques allow attackers to hide malicious instructions in what appear to be benign inputs, leading to outcomes like deepfakes or misinformation while evading easy detection ([Security Vulnerability Analyses of Large Language Models (LLMs) through Extension of the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) Framework](https://www.scirp.org/pdf/jsea2024175_99303262.pdf#:~:text=the%20modification%20or%20paraphrasing%20of,Various%20attack%20techniques)). This observation led the authors to define a new attack category termed **“Adversarial Manipulation in text-to-image generation LLMs,”** highlighting the sophistication of prompt-based attacks in systems like DALL-E ([
	Security Vulnerability Analyses of Large Language Models (LLMs) through Extension of the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) Framework
](https://www.scirp.org/journal/paperinformation?paperid=133503#:~:text=Figure%202,19%5D)) ([

](https://www.scirp.org/journal/paperinformation?paperid=133503#:~:text=the%20literature%2C%20ensuring%20comprehensive%20coverage,E)). The insight here is that **LLM vulnerabilities can be realized through very covert input tweaks**, and a robust security framework must account for these indirect, *black-box* exploit strategies. By incorporating this understanding (e.g. via the Access Complexity metric to capture black-box vs. white-box attack conditions), the paper’s framework directly addresses how and why these AI attacks succeed. In summary, the novel concepts introduced – new CVSS metrics and an informed categorization of LLM attack strategies – represent a significant theoretical advancement, allowing for **quantitative, standardized assessment** of AI security issues where previously only ad-hoc or qualitative analysis existed.

## Methodology & Key Findings:
**Methodology:** The authors followed a systematic approach to develop and validate their extended CVSS framework. First, they reviewed **existing work and known vulnerabilities** in LLM applications, such as the OWASP Top 10 for LLMs, which enumerates the most critical risks (with prompt injections topping the list) ([Security Vulnerability Analyses of Large Language Models (LLMs) through Extension of the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) Framework](https://www.scirp.org/pdf/jsea2024175_99303262.pdf#:~:text=2,ten%20key%20vulnerabilities%2C%20including%20prompt)). This helped them zero in on prompt injection and training data poisoning as high-impact vulnerabilities to address. Next, they performed a **comprehensive literature analysis and threat modeling** of these vulnerabilities in practice. In particular, they examined documented attacks on the DALL-E generative model and similar LLM systems ([Security Vulnerability Analyses of Large Language Models (LLMs) through Extension of the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) Framework](https://www.scirp.org/pdf/jsea2024175_99303262.pdf#:~:text=4,E)). By scrutinizing these real-world examples, the authors distilled the key factors that influence how severe and feasible each attack can be – for instance, whether the attacker needs insider access or can operate as an external user, whether they require intimate knowledge of the model (white-box vs. black-box), and how much sustained interaction is needed to achieve the malicious outcome ([Security Vulnerability Analyses of Large Language Models (LLMs) through Extension of the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) Framework](https://www.scirp.org/pdf/jsea2024175_99303262.pdf#:~:text=The%20exploration%20of%20attacks%20targeting,Various%20attack%20techniques)) ([Security Vulnerability Analyses of Large Language Models (LLMs) through Extension of the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) Framework](https://www.scirp.org/pdf/jsea2024175_99303262.pdf#:~:text=4,They%20are%20challenging%20to)). They also considered the consequences of successful exploits, looking at both technical impact and broader organizational fallout (e.g., reputation damage, operational disruption) as noted in case studies of such attacks. 

Using insights from this analysis, the authors **designed the extended set of CVSS metrics** described earlier (AO, AC, AI, IOI, EOI) and assigned each metric a range of values with corresponding weights/scores. These values were chosen based on a combination of the CVSS methodology and expert judgment drawn from the literature review ([Security Vulnerability Analyses of Large Language Models (LLMs) through Extension of the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) Framework](https://www.scirp.org/pdf/jsea2024175_99303262.pdf#:~:text=Both%20NIST%E2%80%99s%20and%20our%20Exploitability,with%20prompt%20injection%20and%20training)). For example, an *“Internal”* Attack Origin or *“None”* required Attacker Interaction (meaning the attack can run without ongoing input) would each be assigned higher severity weights, since those conditions typically make an attack more dangerous or easier to execute ([Security Vulnerability Analyses of Large Language Models (LLMs) through Extension of the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) Framework](https://www.scirp.org/pdf/jsea2024175_99303262.pdf#:~:text=None%20,executed%20without%20any%20direct%20interaction)) ([Security Vulnerability Analyses of Large Language Models (LLMs) through Extension of the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) Framework](https://www.scirp.org/pdf/jsea2024175_99303262.pdf#:~:text=Internal%20,external%20threat%20actors%20targeting%20the)). The team carefully calibrated these values so that when plugged into the modified CVSS formulas, the resulting scores would reasonably reflect the attack’s overall severity ([Security Vulnerability Analyses of Large Language Models (LLMs) through Extension of the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) Framework](https://www.scirp.org/pdf/jsea2024175_99303262.pdf#:~:text=8,Org%201%20Impact%20External%20Org)) ([Security Vulnerability Analyses of Large Language Models (LLMs) through Extension of the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) Framework](https://www.scirp.org/pdf/jsea2024175_99303262.pdf#:~:text=,2)). They even retained the CVSS base score scaling factor (8.22) to ensure consistency with established CVSS scoring ranges ([Security Vulnerability Analyses of Large Language Models (LLMs) through Extension of the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) Framework](https://www.scirp.org/pdf/jsea2024175_99303262.pdf#:~:text=NIST%20employs%20a%20multiplication%20factor,influence%20on%20the%20overall%20Base)). In short, the methodology involved **extending the CVSS metric set via an evidence-based process**: identify what’s different about LLM threats, create metrics to capture those differences, and integrate them into the CVSS scoring formula, all while aligning with the known structure of CVSS.

To demonstrate and validate their framework, the authors **applied it to concrete attack scenarios** gleaned from research. One scenario is a **training data poisoning attack** on an LLM (inspired by an attack on DALL-E) where an adversary continuously injects malicious inputs into the model’s training process to alter its behavior ([Security Vulnerability Analyses of Large Language Models (LLMs) through Extension of the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) Framework](https://www.scirp.org/pdf/jsea2024175_99303262.pdf#:~:text=For%20this%20specific%20attack%20,to%20poison%20the%20training%20data)). Using their extended CVSS, the authors assigned values to each metric for this scenario: *Attack Origin* was marked “Unknown” since the attacker could be internal or external in different cases ([Security Vulnerability Analyses of Large Language Models (LLMs) through Extension of the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) Framework](https://www.scirp.org/pdf/jsea2024175_99303262.pdf#:~:text=For%20this%20specific%20attack%20,metric%20to%20%E2%80%9Chigh%E2%80%9D%20given%20the)); *Access Complexity* was set to “Blackbox” reflecting that the attacker need not have internal knowledge of the model to poison it (they can treat the model as a black-box to be manipulated) ([Security Vulnerability Analyses of Large Language Models (LLMs) through Extension of the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) Framework](https://www.scirp.org/pdf/jsea2024175_99303262.pdf#:~:text=organiza%02tion%E2%80%99s%20specific%20circumstances,to%20poison%20the%20training%20data)); *Attacker Interaction* was rated “High” because the attacker must continuously engage in feeding poison prompts over time to achieve the desired effect ([Security Vulnerability Analyses of Large Language Models (LLMs) through Extension of the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) Framework](https://www.scirp.org/pdf/jsea2024175_99303262.pdf#:~:text=of%20complexity%20involved%20in%20exploiting,to%20poison%20the%20training%20data)). For impact, they assumed a worst-case *High* on both Internal and External Organizational Impact, indicating that a successful poisoning could severely disrupt internal operations and damage the organization’s external reputation or finances ([Security Vulnerability Analyses of Large Language Models (LLMs) through Extension of the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) Framework](https://www.scirp.org/pdf/jsea2024175_99303262.pdf#:~:text=of%20complexity%20involved%20in%20exploiting,to%20poison%20the%20training%20data)). Plugging these into the scoring formula would yield a high severity score (the exact numeric score isn’t explicitly given in the summary, but with multiple “High” factors it would be toward the upper end of the CVSS scale). 

They performed a similar analysis for a **prompt injection attack** scenario (specifically, an adversarial prompt to a generative model like DALL-E that causes it to produce harmful content) ([Security Vulnerability Analyses of Large Language Models (LLMs) through Extension of the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) Framework](https://www.scirp.org/pdf/jsea2024175_99303262.pdf#:~:text=vulnerabil%02ity,to%20achieve%20the%20desired%20malicious)). In that case, they noted the attacker only needs to provide a single carefully crafted prompt to the model – essentially a one-shot exploit – so *Attacker Interaction* was set to “Low” (minimal ongoing effort) ([Security Vulnerability Analyses of Large Language Models (LLMs) through Extension of the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) Framework](https://www.scirp.org/pdf/jsea2024175_99303262.pdf#:~:text=vulnerabil%02ity,to%20achieve%20the%20desired%20malicious)). Other metrics like *Attack Origin* were again considered “Unknown” (since the threat could come from any user) and *Access Complexity* as “Blackbox” (the attacker does not need insider information, just the ability to query the model) ([Security Vulnerability Analyses of Large Language Models (LLMs) through Extension of the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) Framework](https://www.scirp.org/pdf/jsea2024175_99303262.pdf#:~:text=paper%2C%20we%E2%80%99ve%20determined%20the%20%E2%80%9Caccess,to%20achieve%20the%20desired%20malicious)). The impacts were again rated high for demonstration, underlining that even a simple prompt injection could have far-reaching consequences (imagine, for example, a public chatbot being tricked into leaking confidential info or generating scandalous content – the external damage could be significant) ([Security Vulnerability Analyses of Large Language Models (LLMs) through Extension of the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) Framework](https://www.scirp.org/pdf/jsea2024175_99303262.pdf#:~:text=at%02tacker%20simply%20needs%20to%20create,to%20achieve%20the%20desired%20malicious)). By calculating the CVSS scores for these attack examples, the authors illustrated that **both** prompt injections and data poisoning attacks would score as severe vulnerabilities that demand attention. One key finding is that **without this tailored CVSS approach, such AI-specific issues previously had no clear severity rating** – they would not even show up on traditional vulnerability radar because CVSS did not account for them ([Security Vulnerability Analyses of Large Language Models (LLMs) through Extension of the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) Framework](https://www.scirp.org/pdf/jsea2024175_99303262.pdf#:~:text=With%20our%20newly%20introduced%20metrics%2C,training%20data%20poisoning%20vulnerabilities%2C%20and)). The paper explicitly notes that prior to their work, organizations lacked a means to evaluate the severity of prompt injection or training data poisoning, which could lead to these risks being overlooked ([Security Vulnerability Analyses of Large Language Models (LLMs) through Extension of the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) Framework](https://www.scirp.org/pdf/jsea2024175_99303262.pdf#:~:text=With%20our%20newly%20introduced%20metrics%2C,training%20data%20poisoning%20vulnerabilities%2C%20and)). Now, with the extended CVSS, these vulnerabilities can be quantified and flagged, effectively *alerting organizations to their potential impact* in a familiar format ([Security Vulnerability Analyses of Large Language Models (LLMs) through Extension of the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) Framework](https://www.scirp.org/pdf/jsea2024175_99303262.pdf#:~:text=With%20our%20newly%20introduced%20metrics%2C,training%20data%20poisoning%20vulnerabilities%2C%20and)).

**Key Findings and Insights:** Through this methodology, the paper arrives at several important findings:

- **LLM Vulnerabilities Can Be Quantified:** A major result is proof-of-concept that even unconventional AI threats like prompt manipulation and training data poisoning can be systematically analyzed and given a numeric severity score. This is somewhat counterintuitive in that these AI issues don’t exploit software flaws in the traditional sense, yet the study shows they can still be evaluated with a modified security framework. The finding reassures stakeholders that **established cybersecurity tools (like CVSS) can be adapted to AI**, providing continuity in how we handle emerging threats ([Security Vulnerability Analyses of Large Language Models (LLMs) through Extension of the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) Framework](https://www.scirp.org/pdf/jsea2024175_99303262.pdf#:~:text=secu%02rity%20vulnerabilities%20inherent%20in%20LLMs,and%20development%20in%20this%20field)).

- **High Severity of Prompt Injection & Data Poisoning:** The application of the framework suggests that both prompt injection and data poisoning are **high-severity vulnerabilities** in LLMs, often on par with serious traditional software vulnerabilities. In the examples evaluated, the authors treated the organizational impacts as high, indicating the potential for significant damage ([Security Vulnerability Analyses of Large Language Models (LLMs) through Extension of the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) Framework](https://www.scirp.org/pdf/jsea2024175_99303262.pdf#:~:text=of%20complexity%20involved%20in%20exploiting,to%20poison%20the%20training%20data)) ([Security Vulnerability Analyses of Large Language Models (LLMs) through Extension of the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) Framework](https://www.scirp.org/pdf/jsea2024175_99303262.pdf#:~:text=outcome%20from%20the%20LLM%20through,have%20been%20evaluated%20for%20severity)). This underscores an insight for AI practitioners: what might superficially appear as a harmless glitch (e.g., a model being tricked by a cleverly worded prompt) can in fact pose a serious security risk with broad implications. The structured scoring makes this clear by yielding high risk scores, thereby validating the intuitive concern that these attacks can be very dangerous.

- **Importance of Contextual Factors:** Another key insight is the importance of context—*who* is attacking and *how*. For example, the **Attack Origin** metric highlights that an insider abusing an LLM might be treated differently (and perhaps even more gravely in some cases) than an outside hacker ([Security Vulnerability Analyses of Large Language Models (LLMs) through Extension of the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) Framework](https://www.scirp.org/pdf/jsea2024175_99303262.pdf#:~:text=Internal%20,facing%20assets%20%28eg%3A%20websites%2C%20servers)). Similarly, the **Attacker Interaction** metric differentiates between an exploit that, say, self-propagates versus one that requires constant tweaking by the attacker ([Security Vulnerability Analyses of Large Language Models (LLMs) through Extension of the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) Framework](https://www.scirp.org/pdf/jsea2024175_99303262.pdf#:~:text=4,They%20are%20challenging%20to)). The framework’s ability to capture these nuances is a finding in itself: it shows that **not all AI attacks are equal**, and factors like attacker access level or effort can drastically alter the risk profile. This nuanced approach is a step beyond existing literature, which tended to discuss LLM vulnerabilities more generally. Here, we see a structured way to differentiate a *“simple, one-off”* prompt injection from a *“sophisticated, ongoing”* poisoning campaign, which is valuable for prioritizing defensive measures.

- **Framework Efficacy and Limitations:** The study finds that their extended CVSS framework is effective in **enhancing vulnerability management for LLMs**. In practice, this means organizations could plug details of an LLM-related incident into this scoring system and get a clearer sense of how urgent or dangerous it is. An interesting (and somewhat surprising) takeaway is just how much of a gap existed prior to this work – critical LLM issues had no severity rating at all before, which could leave organizations blind to significant risks ([Security Vulnerability Analyses of Large Language Models (LLMs) through Extension of the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) Framework](https://www.scirp.org/pdf/jsea2024175_99303262.pdf#:~:text=With%20our%20newly%20introduced%20metrics%2C,training%20data%20poisoning%20vulnerabilities%2C%20and)). Now, with a quantitative score, AI developers and security teams can communicate about LLM vulnerabilities with the same rigor as they do for network or software vulnerabilities. That said, the authors acknowledge that their model is in an **early stage**. They consider the current framework a foundational step that will need refinement and tuning as more data on LLM attacks becomes available ([Security Vulnerability Analyses of Large Language Models (LLMs) through Extension of the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) Framework](https://www.scirp.org/pdf/jsea2024175_99303262.pdf#:~:text=novel%20technologies%20like%20LLMs,to%20further%20refinement%2C%20our%20enhanced)). This candid assessment is itself a finding: it signals that while the approach works on the cases studied, a lot of future work (e.g., industry feedback, additional case studies) will be necessary to polish the metrics and perhaps adjust weightings. In summary, the methodology successfully demonstrates a viable way to score AI vulnerabilities, and the key findings highlight both the *severity of LLM threats* and the *feasibility of integrating AI risk into standard security practices*. It’s a breakthrough in moving from recognizing AI vulnerabilities qualitatively to managing them quantitatively.

## Future Predictions & Implications:
The paper concludes with a forward-looking perspective on how this extended CVSS framework could influence the future of AI security and what developments might arise. A central prediction is that as LLMs continue to evolve and permeate various applications, **having a refined vulnerability scoring system will become increasingly critical** ([Security Vulnerability Analyses of Large Language Models (LLMs) through Extension of the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) Framework](https://www.scirp.org/pdf/jsea2024175_99303262.pdf#:~:text=Our%20initiative%20seeks%20to%20enhance,these%20powerful%20large%20language%20models)). The authors envision their extended CVSS framework serving as a **guiding tool for organizations “as a beacon”** in navigating new security risks that come with advanced AI integration ([Security Vulnerability Analyses of Large Language Models (LLMs) through Extension of the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) Framework](https://www.scirp.org/pdf/jsea2024175_99303262.pdf#:~:text=Our%20initiative%20seeks%20to%20enhance,these%20powerful%20large%20language%20models)). In practical terms, this could mean that in the near future, any organization deploying LLMs (for instance, in chatbots, content generation, or decision support systems) will incorporate AI-specific vulnerability assessments into their regular security audits. We might see AI models being regularly evaluated for prompt injection risk or training data integrity as part of standard risk management, much like web applications are checked for OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities today.

The study also implies some broader **trends in AI security**. One anticipated trend is a closer merging of AI governance and cybersecurity policy. If frameworks like this CVSS extension gain traction, industry standards or even regulations could emerge that require companies to report or address LLM vulnerabilities with a certain severity score. For example, regulators concerned with AI safety might begin to ask organizations, “What’s the CVSS (extended) score of your AI system’s worst vulnerability?” – pushing for more transparency and proactive mitigation in AI deployments. This would mirror how critical software vulnerabilities (say, CVSS 9.0 and above) often require immediate patches and disclosures. With a reliable scoring mechanism, **policymakers could set thresholds for acceptable risk in AI systems**, potentially leading to safer deployments across the board.

The authors stress the **need for ongoing research** in this domain ([Security Vulnerability Analyses of Large Language Models (LLMs) through Extension of the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) Framework](https://www.scirp.org/pdf/jsea2024175_99303262.pdf#:~:text=has%20studied%20real,the%20integrity%20and%20trustworthiness%20of)). They predict that as new types of attacks on LLMs are discovered (which is very likely given the fast development of both AI and attacking techniques), the CVSS framework will need to be updated further. Future work may involve extending the framework to cover other items in the LLM threat landscape – for instance, vulnerabilities like model inversion attacks (extracting private training data) or model evasion attacks (tricking an AI’s content filters) could be studied and given their own metric adjustments. The paper’s approach could also be generalized to *other kinds of AI models* (not just large language or text-to-image models). A possible future direction is creating similar scoring extensions for vulnerabilities in **Vision AI systems**, **reinforcement learning agents**, or other **foundation models**, since each might have unique risk factors. This indicates a trend toward **unified AI security frameworks** – we may eventually talk about a “CVSS for AI” that covers a spectrum of AI technologies, and this paper is an early step in that direction.

In terms of **technology development and real-world applications**, the implications are significant. For developers and AI engineers, having a clear metric for vulnerability severity could inform design choices: for example, if prompt injection scores as a high risk in a given application, developers might invest more in prompt sanitization, user input validation, or fine-tuning the model to resist such inputs. It could also drive the development of **automated AI security assessment tools** that evaluate an LLM (via red-teaming or testing) and output an extended CVSS score for its vulnerabilities. Such tools would be invaluable for large organizations deploying multiple AI systems – they could continuously monitor the “vulnerability score” of their models much like they do for servers or software services. The framework also opens up possibilities for **cross-disciplinary tools** – imagine integrating the extended CVSS into AI model card documentation or risk dashboards, so stakeholders (even non-technical ones) can see a quantifiable risk level for the AI. This can enhance understanding and communication about AI risks at the management and board level, potentially influencing decisions around AI deployment and insurance (e.g., cyber insurance might one day ask for AI vulnerability scores as part of coverage considerations).

The paper hints at an important future trend of viewing AI security in a more **holistic, human-centric way**. By including metrics for internal and external impact, the authors implicitly predict that organizations will pay more attention to how AI failures affect not just IT systems but people and processes ([Security Vulnerability Analyses of Large Language Models (LLMs) through Extension of the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) Framework](https://www.scirp.org/pdf/jsea2024175_99303262.pdf#:~:text=The%20first%20metric%20we%20propose,sensitive%20information%2C%20and%20reputational%20damage)) ([Security Vulnerability Analyses of Large Language Models (LLMs) through Extension of the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) Framework](https://www.scirp.org/pdf/jsea2024175_99303262.pdf#:~:text=The%20second%20metric%20we%20propose,%E2%80%9D%20The%20list%20of)). This aligns with a broader industry trend towards AI ethics and safety: technical robustness is crucial, but so is understanding societal and organizational impact. We can anticipate that future frameworks might even extend beyond what this paper proposes, perhaps incorporating metrics for **psychological safety** (to what extent could an AI’s failure cause panic or misinformation in society) or **environmental impact** (if relevant). While these specific ideas are beyond the paper’s scope, the inclusion of organizational impact metrics is a step in that direction, suggesting that **AI security will be increasingly measured by its real-world consequences, not just technical parameters**.

Finally, the authors’ work implies several **areas for further research**. One immediate area is **empirical validation** of the proposed scoring system – future researchers might collect data on actual LLM security incidents and see how well the extended CVSS scores correlate with observed damage or losses. This would help refine the metric weights and categories. Another area is exploring **countermeasures and their scoring**: for instance, if an organization implements a certain defensive technique (like robust training data vetting or prompt filtering), how does that mitigate the CVSS score? Developing a library of **mitigation strategies mapped to score reductions** could be extremely useful in practice. Additionally, research could expand on this framework by integrating it with **AI risk management frameworks** (such as NIST’s AI Risk Management Framework), combining security scoring with considerations of fairness, transparency, and reliability. In terms of real-world application, the path forward could involve **industry consortiums or standard bodies** evaluating this approach. If adopted, it might lead to an official extension of CVSS or a new standard specifically for AI. In summary, the paper sets the stage for a future where **quantitative risk assessment becomes a norm in AI safety**, influencing everything from technical development to policy and governance. The authors clearly see their contribution as the beginning of this evolution, noting that it *“stands as a beacon”* for guiding organizations in safeguarding the integrity and trustworthiness of LLMs as these technologies continue to advance ([Security Vulnerability Analyses of Large Language Models (LLMs) through Extension of the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) Framework](https://www.scirp.org/pdf/jsea2024175_99303262.pdf#:~:text=Our%20initiative%20seeks%20to%20enhance,these%20powerful%20large%20language%20models)).

## Critical Analysis:
**Strengths:** This paper’s strength lies in its **pioneering integration of AI vulnerabilities into a proven cybersecurity framework**. By extending CVSS, the authors leverage a familiar system, which makes their proposals accessible to cybersecurity professionals and easier to adopt by industry ([Security Vulnerability Analyses of Large Language Models (LLMs) through Extension of the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) Framework](https://www.scirp.org/pdf/jsea2024175_99303262.pdf#:~:text=The%20Common%20Vulnerability%20Scoring%20System,to%20defend%20against%20potential%20risks)). The approach is well-grounded in existing security knowledge (like OWASP’s LLM risk list) and enriched by academic research on real attacks, lending credibility to the new metrics ([Security Vulnerability Analyses of Large Language Models (LLMs) through Extension of the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) Framework](https://www.scirp.org/pdf/jsea2024175_99303262.pdf#:~:text=4,E)) ([Security Vulnerability Analyses of Large Language Models (LLMs) through Extension of the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) Framework](https://www.scirp.org/pdf/jsea2024175_99303262.pdf#:~:text=2,ten%20key%20vulnerabilities%2C%20including%20prompt)). The introduction of organizational impact metrics is particularly commendable – it demonstrates foresight by quantifying business and user-facing consequences of AI breaches, bridging a gap between technical risk and business risk ([Security Vulnerability Analyses of Large Language Models (LLMs) through Extension of the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) Framework](https://www.scirp.org/pdf/jsea2024175_99303262.pdf#:~:text=The%20first%20metric%20we%20propose,sensitive%20information%2C%20and%20reputational%20damage)) ([Security Vulnerability Analyses of Large Language Models (LLMs) through Extension of the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) Framework](https://www.scirp.org/pdf/jsea2024175_99303262.pdf#:~:text=The%20second%20metric%20we%20propose,%E2%80%9D%20The%20list%20of)). This holistic view is a strong addition to the AI security literature, which often focuses narrowly on technical aspects. The framework is also **actionable**: it doesn’t just identify problems but provides a means to measure them, which is vital for practical risk management. In terms of writing, the paper is systematic and clear in defining each new metric and justifying its inclusion. By providing formulas and tables of values, the authors make it straightforward for others to understand and potentially implement the scoring system. Moreover, acknowledging that this is an initial model and inviting further refinement ([Security Vulnerability Analyses of Large Language Models (LLMs) through Extension of the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) Framework](https://www.scirp.org/pdf/jsea2024175_99303262.pdf#:~:text=novel%20technologies%20like%20LLMs,to%20further%20refinement%2C%20our%20enhanced)) is a sign of academic rigor – it shows the authors are aware of the framework’s limitations and encourages the community to build on it, rather than claiming it as a final solution.

**Limitations:** Despite its contributions, the paper has some limitations. One is that the framework has been demonstrated only on a **limited set of attack scenarios** (primarily prompt injection and training data poisoning in the context of a text-to-image model). While these are important exemplars, the evaluation could be broadened. Other types of LLM vulnerabilities (e.g., model output manipulation via adversarial examples, model extraction attacks, or misuse of the model to generate disinformation at scale) are not explicitly scored in this work. Thus, the generality of the framework across *all* LLM threats remains to be proven. Another limitation is the **subjectivity in metric assignment**. Determining that an impact is “High” or an attack requires “Low” interaction can sometimes be debatable and context-dependent. The authors base these on literature and reasonable judgement, but different experts might rate the same scenario differently. This means that while the framework is a great guideline, in practice there might be **variability in scoring** unless further standardized. Additionally, adding several new metrics increases the complexity of the scoring process. CVSS is valued for being a concise set of metrics; expanding it means analysts have more factors to consider, which could introduce error or inconsistency if not carefully managed. There’s also the challenge of **validation**: since LLM security incidents are not as well-documented as traditional IT vulnerabilities, it’s hard to statistically validate that the extended CVSS scores truly correlate with real-world risk. The paper is forward-looking in that sense, and its proposals might benefit from more data as incidents occur or as more researchers test the system. 

In the context of the **current AI security landscape**, this work fits in as one of the first attempts to **standardize AI vulnerability assessment**. It complements efforts like the OWASP LLM Top 10 (which identifies what can go wrong) by providing a way to measure *how bad it is when it does go wrong*. The paper’s approach aligns with a growing recognition that AI systems need the same level of security rigor as traditional software. It echoes concerns raised in the community about prompt injection and data poisoning, offering a concrete tool to tackle those concerns. Compared to other research, which might focus on developing specific defenses (like better filters or training techniques), this work takes a higher-level, *framework-driven perspective*. In that regard, it is somewhat unique – it doesn’t introduce a new defense mechanism, but rather a new way to **think about and prioritize defenses**. This is a strength, as it can guide where defensive research and investment should focus (e.g., if prompt injection scores very high, more resources should go into mitigating it). However, one must also note that as an analytical framework, its impact will depend on adoption. The true test will be if organizations and researchers start using this extended CVSS in practice or in academic studies. If it gains traction, it could greatly standardize how we discuss AI vulnerabilities. If not, it might remain an academic exercise. Given the urgent need for AI safety standards, the chances are good that this work will inspire further development. In conclusion, *“Security Vulnerability Analyses of LLMs through Extension of CVSS”* is a timely and meaningful contribution with a strong foundational idea. It effectively raises awareness that LLMs have **measurable security weaknesses**, and provides a clear starting framework to address them. Its strengths in innovation and practicality outweigh its current limitations, and it sits as an important piece in the puzzle of making AI systems safer and more trustworthy ([Security Vulnerability Analyses of Large Language Models (LLMs) through Extension of the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) Framework](https://www.scirp.org/pdf/jsea2024175_99303262.pdf#:~:text=secu%02rity%20vulnerabilities%20inherent%20in%20LLMs,and%20development%20in%20this%20field)) ([Security Vulnerability Analyses of Large Language Models (LLMs) through Extension of the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) Framework](https://www.scirp.org/pdf/jsea2024175_99303262.pdf#:~:text=Our%20initiative%20seeks%20to%20enhance,these%20powerful%20large%20language%20models)). The paper encourages the community to build upon it, heralding a future where AI security assessment could become as standard and quantifiable as traditional IT security is today.
