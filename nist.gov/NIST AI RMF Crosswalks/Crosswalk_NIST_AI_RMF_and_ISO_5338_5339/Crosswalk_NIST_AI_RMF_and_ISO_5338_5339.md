Crosswalk between NIST AI RMF 1.0[1] and ISO/IEC 5338:2023 Al system life cycle processes[2] and ISO/IEC 5339 Guidance for Al applications[3]

The AI RMF and the two international standards were developed independently with some shared foundations with ISO/IEC 22989:2022[4]. This document highlights their areas in common and where the AI RMF can be used to inform readers and users of ISO/IEC 5338 and ISO/IEC 5339.

## Al Risk Management as the Foundation of Responsible Development and Use of Al systems

Figure 1 shows the Make, Use and Impact perspectives of the stakeholders on an Al application and its context from ISO/IEC 5339. Indicated in red in the Figure are where these perspectives could be enhanced by taking the risk management advice and the fundamental aspects of risk from AI RMF.

## Al system life cycle, application context and its audience

Figure 2 shows the life cycle stages of an Al system in Al RMF aligned with those used in ISO/IEC 5338 and ISO/IEC 5339.

Figure 3 shows the key dimensions and context of an AI system from AI RMF aligned with the processes (5.3.4) and context (5.2) described in ISO/IEC 5339.

Figure 4 shows the alignment between the people and planet dimensions from AI RMF and the impact on various stakeholders in ISO/IEC 5339 (5.3.2, 5.3.3). The Al actors in Al RMF (Appendix A) are also similar to the stakeholders in ISO/IEC 5339.

The characteristics of trustworthy Al systems in Al RMF and the discussion of trustworthiness in ISO/IEC 5339 are compared in Table 1. The discussion of trustworthiness in ISO/IEC 5339 were mostly derived from ISO/IEC 22989 and ISO/IEC 24028 so it does not align exactly with those from AI RMF. The AI RMF characteristics of trustworthy AI systems are socio-technical system attributes. In contrast, ISO/IEC 5339 refers to comparative characteristics as Al application nonfunctional characteristics.

Figure 5 shows the relationship between the AI RMF Core (GOVERN, MAP, MEASURE, MANAGE) and the Al application stakeholders' perspectives from ISO/IEC 5339. The Al RMF Core represents a very high-level view and "Governance is designed to be a cross-cutting function to inform and be infused throughout the other three functions" ([1] Figure 5). The MAP function can inform the Make perspective. The MEASURE function can inform the Use perspective. The MANAGE function can inform the Impact perspective.
