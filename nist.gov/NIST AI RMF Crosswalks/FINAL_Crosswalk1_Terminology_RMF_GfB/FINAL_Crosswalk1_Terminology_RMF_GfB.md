| Fair: Fairness in AI includes concerns for equality and equity by addressing<br>issues such as harmful bias and discrimination. Standards of fairness can<br>be complex and difficult to define because perceptions of fairness differ<br>among cultures and may shift depending on application.<br>Harmful Bias Managed: Bias exists in many forms and can become<br>ingrained in the automated systems that help make decisions about our<br>lives. While bias is not always a negative phenomenon, Al systems can<br>potentially increase the speed and scale of biases and perpetuate and<br>amplify harms to individuals, groups, communities, organizations, and<br>society.   NIST identifies three major categories of Al bias to be managed<br>(below), all of which can occur without prejudice, partiality, or<br>discriminatory intent. | Fairness: In the development, provision, and use of Al systems and<br>services, it is important for Al business actors to make efforts to do away<br>with prejudice and discrimination not to impose unfair or harmful actions<br>against specific individuals or groups based on diverse backgrounds such as<br>race, gender, nationality, age, political opinion, religion, etc. In addition, it<br>is important to recognize that some biases cannot be avoided, and<br>evaluate whether these unavoidable biases are acceptable from the<br>perspective of respecting human rights and diverse cultures. It is important<br>to develop, provide, and use AI systems and services based on this<br>understanding. |
| Systemic bias: can be present in Al datasets, the organizational norms,<br>practices, and processes across the Al lifecycle, and the broader society<br>that uses Al systems.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Note: There are no categories of biases, though the AI GfB presupposes a<br>variety of biases.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
